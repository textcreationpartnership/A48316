            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:65743:5"/>call to minde, that ſuch as are addicted to a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which denyeth that diſparity wherein you are placed, have given that teſtimony of you which I have here obſerved; and more (ſurely) of that ſort would doe you right in the like kinde, if they knew as well as I (and I hope they ſhall know it ere long) how humble you have beene (not humbled as ſome are by the Parliament) and in humility, how hearty and forward to take downe your ſelfe, and to project a forme of Eccleſiaſticall Government, wherein you might be but as one of us in a ſociable participation of Ordination and Juriſdiction with the reſt of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the incumbent Paſtors and Preachers of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches.</p>
            <p>And for the other ſort, who thinke you have but too kindely complyed with the Diſciplinarians of Geneva, and other parts, elſe they would not have honoured you ſo much as they have done, the wiſer and better ſort will take it for a token of your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe; and to take off the offence of ſome (who, in an over high conceit of Epiſcopall preheminence, diſdaine all reformed Churches but thoſe that have it) I can tell them, that Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift entertained a Miniſter of the French Church, one Maſter</hi> Buſe, <hi>to preach a weekly Latine Lecture in his owne Chappell, and to other forraigne Miniſters was very bountifull, as to</hi> Druſius, Rhenicherus, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevill, <hi>whom hee entertained in his owne houſe; and not onely gave liberally to thoſe whoſe merit was farre above their meanes, (when they came within his reach) but ſent his bounty abroad to like objects in forraine parts, as to Maſter</hi> Beza, <hi>hee ſent ſundry times much money out of
<pb facs="tcp:65743:5"/>his owne purſe, beſides the generall collections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions to Geneva, which hee alſo greatly furthered,</hi> as
<note n="g" place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>G. Paul</hi> in the life of Archb. <hi>Whitgift p.</hi> 63, 64.</note> Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> hath written in the relation of his life.</p>
            <p>And it had beene more for the honour of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Prelacie, and much better for the publick peace both of the Church and State, if there had beene more courteous correſpondence betwixt Epiſcopall and Presbyteriall Divines, notwithſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betwixt them in opinion or preheminence.</p>
            <p>But there are a ſort of men, who, whether out of unſoundneſſe in religion, or pride or perverſeneſſe of diſpoſition, or ſome politick intention, I cannot tell, but out of ſome motive (ſurely) which is not good, take ſmall cauſe to raiſe great clamours againſt thoſe whom they ſhould rather reſcue from reproach, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did defame them: Such an one was hee who ſate ſo heavie upon the skirts of the Geneva Bible publickly in the Pulpit, charging the marginall anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with Judaiſme and Arrianiſme, againſt whom I wrote an Apologie about twenty eight yeers agoe, which a double occaſion now calleth to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the one precedent, the other preſent.</p>
            <p>The former is, That it was the time of my firſt happy acquaintance with your Grace, when upon your peruſall of ſome part of it, you left a letter for mee (at your departure from Oxford) approving what I had done, and encouraging mee to hold on in clearing their innocency, who were moſt untruly traduced in a ſolemne aſſembly of the whole Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; ſo long ſince is it, that I have had cauſe to obſerve your ſincere affection to all the faithfull Labourers in
<pb facs="tcp:65743:6"/>the Lords vine-yard, whether of Geneva or any other Church of the reformed religion.</p>
            <p>The other occaſion is preſent, and it is the deſire of divers, who wiſh well to the edification of ordinary Readers of the Bible; and therefore deſire that the Geneva notes, after a ſerious review and needfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, may be reſtored to their attendance upon the ſacred Text, from which they have been all this while diſcarded, as if they had been guilty of thoſe heynous accuſations which were objected againſt them, and whereof my book, I doubt not, (by the ſentence of a

            <p>I ſhould have thought that his great learning (well knowne by his printed workes, though againſt the Croſſe, and croſſe to the Croſier) might have ſecured him from ſuch a brutiſh ſcorne, eſpecially from that which degrades him to the loweſt forme, not only of men, but of beaſts; and that as it is hard to prove, ſo none ſhould be haſty to impute either pride or ſchiſm, where conſcience is pretended, reaſons abundantly alledged, and ſecular comforts deſerted, as in his caſe it was; his words did not (mee thinkes) ſo much as tempt, much leſſe authorize any one to returne upon him with ſuch contumelious termes: for did hee ſay any thing againſt the Fathers, that he muſt for that be held unworthy to be called a ſonne? yea, ſo worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as to bee excommunicated from men, and ſorted to beaſts? hee ſaid, <hi>they erred;</hi> and why might hee not? for, were they not men? they <hi>erred in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> they might for all that in matter of doctrine be very learned and Orthodox Doctors: <hi>They erred</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>not out of will, or through apoſtacy or contempt,</hi> but <hi>through want of knowledge</hi> in that particular, and <hi>of infirmity:</hi> they might then (notwithſtanding all this) bee very good and holy men (as indeed they were;) and muſt Maſter <hi>P.</hi> for ſaying but this, bee ſo farre undervalued and vilified, as to bee made but as the embleme of groſſeſt ſtupidity?

            <head>The PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (as many of this generation have uſed the matter) are very unlike: for <hi>that</hi> is fixed on an Hebrew root (which ſignifieth <hi>Reſt</hi>) <hi>this,</hi> as a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery reed (toſſed to and fro with contrary winds, by the manifold oppoſitions that are made about it) almoſt, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>Reſtleſſe.</hi> Not all the Commandements of the Decalogue, beſides that of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (which for number have the oddes of nine to one) have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more or worſe, under the ſtrife of tongues, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of pens, then it hath done.</p>
            <p>It was (by divine Ordinance) to be as <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke: for in that not men alone, but the unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures likewiſe (though moſt diſpoſed to range abroad) were under an arreſt, confined to a narrow compaſſe: and (though otherwiſe adverſe to each other) united in a quiet and peaceable repoſe among themſelves. So on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> both man and beaſt (for that day) were to have each of them their <hi>quietus eſt:</hi> by the one ſort,
<pb facs="tcp:65743:12"/>Reſt was only to be enjoyed as a benefit; to the other it was enjoyned as a duty: but not Reſt onely, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with it; nor Reſt meerly for it ſelfe, but for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions ſake, and that (ſo farre as it conſiſteth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God) is another kind of Reſt, and of all kinds, the beſt, and moſt delightfull.</p>
            <p>But now is this <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or day of reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, become as a Ball, betwixt two Rackets, bandied this way and that way, by mutuall contradiction, not onely betwixt the godly and the profane (which is no newes) but among many of thoſe, who are in no mean accompt in the Church of God, whether they bee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by the eminence of their places, the excellency of their parts, or the holineſſe of their lives.</p>
            <p>The more is the griefe of religious hearts that doe obſerve it, and the more hearty their deſires (no doubt) to ſee ſome good accord (at leaſt betwixt the better ſort) or (which is next unto a peace) that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about it may bee carried with ſuch pious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent moderation (on both ſides) as that God may loſe no part of his tribute of honour, nor his ſervants be defrauded of the fruit of their holineſſe, nor fall to a change or cooling of thoſe charitable affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other, without which <hi>Pomegranats, even the golden Bells of Aaron,</hi> are but <hi>like ſounding braſſe, or tinkling Cimballs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards this purpoſe, if the employment of the Talent committed to my truſt may any way conduce, I ſhall make no ſcruple to adde unto my other taskes an aſſay of ſatisfaction to their Doubts or Reaſons, who either waver in the right, or are already ſwayed to wrong opinions in this point. And to this endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb facs="tcp:65743:12"/>I ſhall with more diligence addreſſe my ſelfe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the day in queſtion, is the training day of military Diſcipline, by which the Church of Chriſt is unto the Synagogue of Satan (as is ſaid in the <hi>Canticles</hi>) <hi>terrible as an Army with Banners:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cantic. 6.4.</note> which, if it ſhould not be well united, and often exerciſed, the powers of darkneſſe would be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted. It containeth (as

The <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> is unto it as the border of <hi>Sinai</hi> to that mountaine of terrour; and as the tower of <hi>Sion,</hi> to that city of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and ſo cannot be battered, or broken down, without an open breach upon Religion it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe as it ſtands in eminency (for force and uſe) ſo it is the faireſt marke for Satans malignity to aime at: and as if he had given his ſouldiers ſome ſuch charge againſt it, as the King of Syria did once againſt the King of Iſrael <hi>[fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt neither ſmall nor great,
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 22.31.</note> but againſt the King of Iſrael]</hi> ſpend all your might againſt his perſon; ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, whether King or Queen of dayes (for both theſe titles are attributed to the day of Reſt, as I ſhall note in another place) are all his forces ſet in battell array, and though (in ſome reſpects) adverſe to one another; yet in their way, they all of them doe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Lords ſacred ordinance of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Some endeavouring to undermine and ſupplant the fabricke of it, from the very foundation (on which it
<pb facs="tcp:65743:13"/>is ſet); and others piling upon it ſo many over rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous poſitions and obſervances, as with their ſad and ſullen weight may incline it to crack and fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The neceſſary inſtruction of the people in the heads of Catechiſme, preſſed by eſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our dread Soveraigne that late was, and of his Majeſtie that now is, maketh the Decalogue, (and within it the Commandement of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) a more common <hi>Theme</hi> for popular diſcourſes, and therewith. all a more fruitfull ground of erroneous deſcants then heretofore, if in ſuch variety of opinions (which caſt a miſt upon the truth) there be not ſome more means to cleare it, and to guide men to that choice, from which too many now endeavour to ſeduce them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I obſerved, that as ſome ſet their wits on worke to impeach the piety of the doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> ſo many ſet their wils either to worke or play, and ſo to purſue their profit or pleaſure, as to make the <hi>Lords</hi> holiday every way in practice, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy and profane, as in poſition it could be: Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Libertiniſme being a deſcent from Sion hill, which hath no need of hands to thruſt it downewards towards hell.</p>
            <p>It was well ſaid of a grave
<note n="c" place="margin">The Biſh. of S. Aſaph.</note> Prelate (when hee heard of ſome too indulgent doctrines this way) that <hi>therules of manners ſhould be ſtrict, for mens behaviour would incline faſt enough to looſeneſſe of themſelves.</hi> Beſides, there is a ſiniſter zeale in ſome againſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, which proveth many times prejudiciall to the practice of religion: for (as our late learned
<note n="d" place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Cign. cant.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.8.</note> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne hath obſerved) <hi>under colour of weeding out ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
<pb facs="tcp:65743:13"/>it will pluck up by the roots many plants of Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And wee ſee but too many ill harveſt men, uſing the weeding hooke to the wheat, which ſhould bee exerciſed onely to plucke up the tares: of whoſe ill worke I ſhall beware for my ſelfe, and (I hope) ſhall give ſuch warning unto others, as may not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them from the like; but may bee a direction to the ſimpler ſort, what to take, and what to take heed of, as either of them ſhall bee offered to their choice.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, While men make no ſcruple to violate the holy <hi>reſt</hi> of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> they become the more bold to diſobey their Superiours, (whether ſupreme or ſubordinate); for,
<note place="margin">Mat. 22. v. 31.</note> as giving to <hi>God the things that are Gods, and unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars, are ſociable duties, and well ſort together; ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, where dues are denyed &amp; detained from God, the King is not like to receive his right, either for aid, or obedience: for the fourth and fifth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are ſo neere neighbours, that the like lot (whether of obſervance or of ſleighting) is like to befall them; which wee may well perceive, if wee doe but obſerve how our people have lately fallen, not onely from piety, but from civility, and broke out into manifold offences againſt the lawes of the King, ſince they were taught (a leſſon too eaſily learned) to make light of this holy Commandement of God.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any cauſe to expect any better beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour among them, untill their conſciences (let looſe from this bond) bee tucked up to it by a more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious regard, both of the authority and obſervation
<pb facs="tcp:65743:14"/>of the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> Then may wee have more hope, and not till then, under our Governours, (for whom the Apoſtle preſcribeth all manner of prayer) <hi>to lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Theſe motives were the more ſharpned, and I the more quickned (for the ſafer conduct of them that doubt) to ſet out my light (whether candle or torch, I muſt leave to other men to judge) by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſollicitations of many religious and learned friends; but eſpecially by a joynt Letter, (the copie whereof I ſhall preſent to the view of the Reader next after this Preface) ſent me under the hands of many of my Brethren of the Miniſtery, of whom there are divers, for their gifts and parts, of eſpeciall note, and all of them painefull and profitable Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in their places, and ſuch as build up the walls of our Jeruſalem (as with both hands) with ſound doctrine and religious converſation.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Since that time I have received not onely incouragement, but incitement to the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (with a Manuſcript Treatiſe of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) from the hand of a great Prelate, a glorious Starre of the firſt magnitude, ſhining illuſtriouſly in the Church, both by his admirable learning, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable living.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, I was not a little provoked to lend my poore ability to the protection of the truth herein, by the importunate preſſing of Maſter <hi>Breerewood,</hi> whereby Maſter <hi>Nic. Byfield</hi> was forced to the field, when hee had no thought nor minde to fight, (as wee ſhall ſeaſonably note in another place); for when hee
<pb facs="tcp:65743:14"/>had excuſed himſelfe, for being unwilling to enter the liſts of controverſie with him, as wanting warrant to leave his calling, and to ſpend his time about ſuch confutations, Maſt. <hi>Breerwood</hi> returnes upon him with this patheticall expoſtulation:</p>
            <p>
               <note n="e" place="margin">M <hi>Breerw.</hi> his firſt Treat. of the <hi>Sabbath, p.</hi> 89, 90.</note> 
               <hi>How, Sir? is the defending of the doctrine you have taught, a leaving of your calling? Are you called to teach the truth, and not to defend it? Are not Gods Miniſters to defend Chriſts truth? is that no part of their calling? or have you no warrant, ſay you, for ſuch confutations? What? no warrant to confute them in the behalfe of the truth, whom ye yet condemn for adverſaries of the truth? Why, Chriſt is the authour of the truth,
<note place="margin">John 14.6.</note> or the truth it ſelfe; you are a Miniſter of Chriſt, there is a warrant for you: The holy Ghoſt is the ſpirit of truth,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.13.</note> and he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied you to that Miniſtry, there is a warrant for you: The Goſpel is the word of truth, you are a Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, there is a warrant for you: The Church is the Pillar of truth, you are a Pillar of the Church, there is a more warrant for you: For would not the Authour of the truth, the ſpirit of truth, &amp;c. (and to all theſe you owe your ſervice and allegiance have their Miniſter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the truth? A ſtrange thing, that Chriſts Miniſters ſhould have no warrant to confute oppoſitions made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, who are bound to give their lives in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it! Muſt they ſpend their life and bloud for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it? and may they not ſpend a little labour and time about ſuch confutations?</hi> So farre he.</p>
            <p>Where, whether the goodneſſe of Maſter <hi>Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> his cauſe, or the apprehenſion of his owne better abilities, and more liſt and leaſure then Maſter <hi>Bifield</hi> had, to reciprocate diſputes of this ſort, did more
<pb facs="tcp:65743:15"/>prompt him to theſe braving provocations, may bee better diſcerned, when their different Tenets come with indifferency to be examined.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, I thought this ſpeech, after ſo many inducements (as before I have touched) though directed to him, was pertinent to mee: And (beſides other reſpects) ſomewhat more to mee, then to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bifield,</hi> in that a great
<note n="f" place="margin">Maſt. <hi>W. C.</hi>
               </note> Admirer of Maſter <hi>Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> brought mee divers of his Dictats on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which are not in print) that I might peruſe them, and ſo might either take the impreſſion of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from them: or (if my judgement ſwayed mee otherwiſe) that I might endeavour to take off the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his and other mens miſ-conceipts, by ſome better evidence of truth herein, then yet had been offered to their view.</p>
            <p>At this marke while I direct mine aime, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe mine endeavours, my reſolution is, and care ſhall be, to deale with ſuch diligence, as not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any meanes of due information in matters of doubt, and with ſuch fidelity, as not to tell a lye for God, nor to out-face a truth againſt the meaneſt man.</p>
            <p>And, if while I devote my thoughts &amp; pains to make ſome truths (not of meere ſpeculation, but of ordinary practice) to ſhine (which have been obſcured with manifold ſcruples) and to fence them from the ſtorme of ſome mens oppoſitions, it bee mine hap to derive contradictions upon my ſelfe, it ſhall not diſcourage mee from any duty I owe unto the truth: for, he that gain-ſayeth me in that, maketh himſelfe <hi>Gods adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary more then mine;</hi> for, truth is not any mans ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:65743:15"/>as his, who (I hope) will give mee eyes to ſee both what wrong is done unto it, and by what meanes, and in what manner it ſhould be righted.</p>
            <p>But if the exception he taketh againſt what I write be true and juſt, I will take it for a matter not of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, but of gratification: for I ſhall accompt it a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if he ſhew mee an errour of mine owne (and it ſhall be no longer mine, then untill it be ſeen) which yet I ſee not.</p>
            <p>For which diſcovery, I ſhall hold it my duty to give him thankes, without taking offence at any good office hee performeth for the truth, and ſhall alwaies be ready to debate any doubtfull dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſo, as (with the
<note n="g" place="margin">Et refellere ſine pertinacia, &amp; refelli ſine iracundia, parati ſumus. <hi>Cicer. Tuſ. qu. l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 137. 5.</note> Oratour) to give or receive a refutation without pertinacy, or paſſion, and (as

               <hi>Lucius Albinus</hi> and his friend) to joyne my necke with his in the yoak, ſociably to draw not the waine of our vaine conceipts or ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wills, but the chariot of truth, that ſhee may ride on in ſtate and triumph: which will (I am ſure) be the laſt iſſue of theſe Sabbathary diſſentions, wherein falſhood (though for a time it may advance, as Pageants doe, by an unnaturall and violent force) ſhall fall under her wheele, and receive the reward of the wicked, by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> doome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.26.</p>
            <p>In hope whereof, and heart by that hope, I ſhall betake my ſelfe to my taske, which will bee a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcourſe: The former <hi>Hiſtoricall,</hi> wherein I ſhall ſhew how the controverſie of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Primitive, to the preſent times. The later <hi>Doctrinall</hi> and <hi>Practicall,</hi> in which the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:65743:16"/>of the Doctrine ſhall be diſcuſſed, and the duties of practiſe accordingly delivered.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we can treat of none of them, without the uſe of Termes and Names, which are called in queſtion, and by ſome condemned of profaneneſſe, or Judaiſme, eſpecially the name
<note n="i" place="margin">In the book, called <hi>Sunday no Sabbath,</hi> made by Doct. <hi>Pockl.</hi>

In all which, the God of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> be mine aide and guide. Amen.</p>

               <p>The title <hi>Lords day</hi> is not taken from Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.26. wherein hee ſaith, <hi>the earth is the Lords,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Howſoever that diſtinction prove (and though it be true and pertinent, it is, I confeſſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nice and curious, ſo that few, upon their owne reading of the Scripture, will take notice of it); yet the diſtinction of

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65743:27"/>ſo nameth by way of oppoſition unto it; for hee came that day, and, as by a new and admirable birth, <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to many, Mark</hi> 16.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To prevent miſtaking of the Tenet, which I hold in the triall of right betwixt the day of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Reſurrection, and other dayes ſet up with it in competition for the title <hi>Lords day; I profeſſe with

               </head>
               <p>THere bee many dayes that are ſet up with the day of our Saviours Reſurrection, in conteſtation for this title <hi>Lords day,</hi> (as in the precedent Chapter hath partly been obſerved) viz. <hi>The old Sabbath, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Birth day, the day of his Paſsion, Aſcenſion, the day of his Apparition to Saint</hi> John, and <hi>the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt for the <hi>old Sabbath</hi> (for here it may have the firſt place,
<note n="I" place="margin">The old Sabbath.</note> though I have given reaſons why elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where I ranke it otherwiſe) concerning which I ſay, though in the fourth Commandement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. it be called [<hi>the Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi>] and ſo in that reſpect (albeit it bee there rather declaratively then preceptively brought in) it may bee named the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as

And in his Defence, ſaith he, <hi>The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath;</hi> Wherefore the ſeventh dayes Sabbath may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the <hi>Lords day.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Brab.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>pag.</hi> 238.</note> Maſter <hi>Braburne</hi> pleadeth; yet that is but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intimation, not by formall denomination, as S. <hi>John</hi> hath it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though it had been called expreſſely by the name of the <hi>Lords day</hi> in the old Teſtament, (and ſo long as it was in force, it was indeed the <hi>Lords day</hi> in eſpeciall maner, as is the day we celebrate now)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65743:28"/>yet it is not probable that day being generally noted by the name of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> from its firſt originall, both in the old Teſtament, and in the new, that Saint <hi>John</hi> would entitle it by a new name, having an old one already of pertinent importance, and permanent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, eſpecially there being a new day of eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all note, and capable of that new title, (as

               <p>Secondly,
<note n="II" place="margin">The day of Chriſts Birth.</note> for the day of <hi>Chriſts Birth,</hi> or <hi>his firſt comming,</hi> albeit it bee a day of high account, yet the time of it was ſo farre from being ſo illuſtrious in the primitive times as that day which wee call the <hi>Lords day,</hi> that neither the day of the weeke is certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, nor the day of the moneth, nor the moneth of the yeere, no nor the yeere of our Lord ſo cleared, but that there is and hath beene much controverſie about them.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65743:28"/>day of the Reſurrection, which it was in the order of the weeke, a matter of chiefe moment in a weekely holiday, for that there was good agreement on all hands, there being cleare texts of Scripture to take off all doubt in that reſpect.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that though it bee granted to be a

                  <hi>that one might ſit on his right hand, and the other on his left;</hi> yet it implyed a little modeſtie and good manners, that ſhee left the middle place, as the prime place, to Chriſt himſelfe, as a Judge on the Bench, with his Aſſiſtants and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors on either ſide.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In this ſituation of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65743:30"/>our Saviour, it hath on the one ſide, the black ſhadow of his <hi>Paſsion;</hi> on the other, the reſlexive rayes of his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> to add to its glory: for, ſo ſoone as hee had raiſed himſelfe from the dead, his glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die had its qualification for aſcent, and was readily diſpoſed thereunto, if the time had beene come: and when it did come, as his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> made an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of honour to his <hi>Paſsion,</hi> (for it gave proof, that his life was rather freely given by himſelfe, then forcibly taken from him by others); ſo did his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> to his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> for that gave evidence that his bodie was raiſed with all thoſe excellent qualifications which made it meet to mount up on high, and much more ſit for heaven then for earth; and though hee tarried ſtill below in his perſon, his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was not the leſſe glorious for that; the Angels of heaven are as excellent ſpirits when they come downe <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, as when they goe up.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of our Saviour, locally conſidered, be an high degree of elevation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> yet, Theologically taken, it hath not ſuch an exaltation of dignity above it; for his high humility in converſing ſtill among men on earth, when hee might have immediately moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up into heaven, addeth much to the honour of his <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> for, <hi>hereby</hi> (as

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65743:31"/>leſſe a King on earth, but an holyer, humbler ſubject to the King of heaven in the one poſture, then in the other?</p>
               <p>If altitude of place muſt carry away the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of things and perſons, the fowles of the aire would flie up with it, and leave men, as their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, on earth below; who, by Gods primitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment were to bee their lords, and to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſoveraigntie over them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But howſoever the compariſon betwixt the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> go, in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet in reſpect of men, who are to make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them both, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable in theſe reſpects;</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was made knowne unto more by his ſeverall apparitions, both to more in number, and more oft in time; for hee was ſeene at one time to no fewer <hi>then five hundred brethren at once,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. His <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> was ſeen but by a few, viz. but <hi>by his Apoſtles, Act.</hi> 1.2.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for number, ſo for time, his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> was manifeſted more often then his <hi>Aſcenſion;</hi> for, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> obſerveth in that Chapter, <hi>by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infallible tokens, hee was ſeene of them by the ſpace of forty dayes, and ſpake of the things appertaining to the Kingdome of God:</hi> But his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> was ſudden, in a manner in a moment, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was manifeſted to more, and more often, ſo more clearely alſo; as the Sunne at his riſing appeares to us more fully then when it is aſcended to high noone. And it is to bee obſerved, that whereas our Saviours <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is ſet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65743:31"/>downe with aſſured evidence of ſenſe, for hee was ſaid to bee ſeene <hi>by many infallible tokens, Acts</hi> 1.3. yea, and hee was felt too; for though hee ſaid to <hi>Mary, Joh.</hi> 20.17. <hi>Touch mee not, for I am not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,</hi> yet did <hi>Thomas</hi> touch him, and put his hand into his ſide, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. But for his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> it was more ſudden, and at further diſtance; and it is noted, that it was leſſe in ſight; for, <hi>when hee aſcended,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Luke, a cloud took him out of their ſight, Act.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> touching the particular day of the moneth, be thought to have been the
<note n="m" place="margin">Chriſtus mortuus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii 25. reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexit Martii 27. aſcendit Maii 5. <hi>Lorin. in Act.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>pag.</hi> 33.</note> ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> and for the day of the weeke, by probable conjecture, be ſuppoſed to have been <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> (for it is but probable, elſe Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> would not have ſaid (as
<note n="n" place="margin">Chryſoſt. apud Lorin. Ibid.</note> hee did) <hi>that hee aſcended on the Sabbath;</hi> nor would it bee doubted (as it is by divers) whether the forty dayes from our Saviours <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> (mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3.) be to be reckoned <hi>incluſively,</hi> as taking in both ends of that accompt; or <hi>excluſively,</hi> for the one or both), yet neither that, viz. the day of his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> nor <hi>good Friday,</hi> nor any other day, which in any ſenſe is called the <hi>Lords day,</hi> is ſo often, and ſo expreſſely and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually noted, with its place, and order in the weeke, as the day on which Chriſt roſe from the dead, which is preciſely obſerved by all the Evangeliſts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of them in all reſpects is ſo fit to bee ſet up for a weekly Holiday, and to be named the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as that is; and being now weekely obſerved (as the dayes of the <hi>Birth, Paſsion,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of Chriſt are not) it hath beſt right to the red Letter, and to bee eminent above the reſt, both in brightneſſe of colour,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65743:32"/>and dignity of denomination, and ſo to bee called the <hi>Dominicall day,</hi> or the <hi>Lords day,</hi>

               <p>Nor can this title bee ſo ſhrunke up in that place where it is mentioned, <hi>ſcil. Rev.</hi> 1.10. as to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the day of the Lords appearance and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Saint <hi>John</hi> (as

               <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle beginneth the narration of the viſion with the time, <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day,</hi> as not onely diſtinguiſhing the time from the Apparition, but premiſing it, as being indeede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He mentioneth the day as a time known already to the Church, as thoſe that report to others a thing done at ſuch a time, preſuppoſe that that time is not unknowne unto them: but the day of his <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to Saint <hi>John</hi> was unknowne, and the day of the Lords <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was not; therefore, it is much more like the day of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> then of his <hi>Apparition</hi> to Saint <hi>John,</hi> was intended by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the <hi>Lords day</hi> and the day of <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition</hi> in this place were the ſame, it were no Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or giving of light to the matter, but the drawing of a curtaine, in ſtead of the opening of a caſement: for this gloſſe doth rather darken, then cleare the text.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To underſtand by the title <hi>Lords day, Rev.</hi> 1.10. the day of his <hi>Apparition</hi> to Saint <hi>John,</hi> or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65743:32"/>the day wherein hee was raviſhed in ſpirit, is, as ſome conceive, to make a meere

               <p>Fifthly, Before Doctor <hi>Gomarus,</hi> not any (at leaſt, none that was held for an orthodoxe Doctor) did ever light upon ſuch an expoſition as this, [viz. <hi>that by the</hi> Lords day, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. <hi>ſhould bee meant the day of the Lords apparition to S.</hi> John,] which the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſeemes ſometimes not ſo well to like, but that (for right to this title <hi>Lords day</hi>)

And for the fancie both of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gomarus</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Braburne,</hi> that by the title <hi>Lords day, Rev.</hi> 1.10. may bee conceived the day of the Lords comming to his laſt Judgement, (for which the one citeth <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.30. the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.) I anſwer, firſt to the opinion it ſelfe, and then to the proofe.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I ſay, That Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, as wee noted before, in the readieſt conſtruction of the words, as of a day that was in being before that Viſion, and ſo knowne, that the Reader might take notice
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65743:33"/>when the Viſion came unto him: but the <hi>day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is not yet come, and ſo unknowne to man, that our Saviour ſaith of it, <hi>but of that day and houre know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man, no not the Angels of heaven, but my Father onely, Mat.</hi> 24.36.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For their proofes, though both places produced be meant of the <hi>day of Judgement;</hi> yet, that they appertaine not to the title now in queſtion, wee may obſerve, that neither of them nameth the day, as Saint <hi>John</hi> doth the <hi>Lords day;</hi> for in the one, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. it is called <hi>the day of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> in the other, <hi>viz. Luk.</hi> 17.30. <hi>the day of the Sonne of man:</hi> So that this device of the <hi>day of judgement</hi> (as to the day pointed out by Saint <hi>John</hi> in his appellation) is void of all judgement, and withall, ſo full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that if any man ſhould goe on in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the <hi>Revelation</hi> throughout, to the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as hee begun with the firſt, hee might thereby derive upon himſelfe a wretched <hi>right</hi> to thoſe plagues, with commination whereof Saint <hi>John</hi> ſhuts up, and ſeales up his myſticall Propheſie, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 22.18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But, if wee take the <hi>Lords day</hi> for the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> (for that, as

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer, Firſt, That the queſtion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65743:33"/>yet is not, whether the <hi>Lords day</hi> ſhould be a weekly Holiday or not: But being ſuch a one in fact, (for yet wee are not come to diſcuſſe in point of right) whether it may not in its weekly recourſe be intituled by that name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the day of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> being ſtill noted in Scripture to bee <hi>the firſt day of the weeke,</hi> and not ſuch a day of the moneth as returnes but once a yeere, or once in halfe a yeere, or once a quarter, or once a moneth onely, it may bee called the <hi>Lords day</hi> once a weeke, for its weekly recourſe, as well as once a yeere, if, as the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> it came no oftner.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that no Friday is called <hi>good Friday,</hi> nor any Thurſday <hi>holy Thurſday,</hi> or <hi>Aſcenſion day,</hi> but one in the yeere; it may bee replied to that, if they were weekly obſerved (as for a time <hi>good Friday</hi> was, and the firſt day of the weeke hath beene ſince the Apoſtles time) they might all be partners in the ſame appellation <hi>(all holy Thurſdaies, all good Fridaies)</hi> as well once a weeke, as once a yeere; though the firſt might have ſome preheminence above the reſt; and after the firſt, that which anſwereth to the firſt in the ſeaſon of the yeere, as well as in the day of the week, and by reaſon thereof (as being no common gueſt) it might have an <hi>Alablaſter box of oyntment</hi> beſtowed upon it, more then upon thoſe which were more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gueſts; as <hi>Eaſter Sunday</hi> was (by a

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>How farre it may bee lawfull to uſe Idolatrous names. An Anſwer to the Objection againſt the name</hi> Sunday.</head>
               <p>ANd firſt for the places of Scripture before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, they doe not imply, in their proprer ſenſe, ſo preciſe a prohibition of all names of idolatrous, or otherwiſe of ſinfull intimation or acception in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that it ſhould be utterly unlawfull to mention them: the name of evill is forbidden ſometimes, to make us more eſtranged from that which is evill; yet not wholly and altogether: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, An evill (as it is evill) may bee reproved, and that under that name by which it is knowne; ſo though the Apoſtle forbid the naming of fornication in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſ. chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. yet himſelfe nameth <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>fornicator,</hi> by way of reproofe, well toward twenty times in his Epiſtles: and in that very place hee could not ſo well have forbidden the thing it ſelfe, if he had not at all made uſe of the name.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65743:42"/>
               <p>Secondly, It may bee lawfull to mention an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous name without reproofe, as
<note n="a" place="margin">M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pagets</hi> arrow againſt the Browniſts <hi>p.</hi> 142, 143.</note> Maſter <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> (though a Browniſt, and ſo a vehement adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to all appearance of idolatry) acknowledgeth, and giveth inſtance in the names <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> and others: to which may be added, the idolatrous name of the Ship wherein <hi>Paul</hi> was carried, which hee called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>(i. e.) Caſtor &amp; Pollux, Act.</hi> 28.11. and this in an idolatrous ſenſe, though without either approbation or reproofe of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, An idolatrous name may bee retained and uſed in a ſenſe not idolatrous, as <hi>Hermes</hi> the name of <hi>Mercury,</hi> mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.14. as it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a particular perſon, and not the Idol of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles called by that name: ſo the names of <hi>Frier, Monke, Abbat, Pope,</hi> as they are names of Families, not of Offices, or Callings, may bee retained ſtill, as
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>M. Ainſw. Ibid. p.</hi> 143.</note> Maſter <hi>Ainſworth</hi> hath acknowledged, though he (as well as Maſter

                  <hi>Paget</hi>) thinks the Popes have beene made great Idols by too many people of all ranks; and ſo think I.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Names that have beene Idolatrous, or any way impious, may in time (having beene long accuſtomed to a better ſenſe) bee ayred and purged from all impiety: for words are like to faſhions, which varie with the times, and ſo either get or loſe grace and acceptation, thereafter as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar uſe, and common cuſtome giveth the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them; in whoſe power it is, (as the
<note n="d" place="margin">Multa rena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentur quae jam cecidere cadentque, Quae nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c ſunt in honore vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabula, ſi volet uſus. <hi>Morat. de arte Poetic.</hi>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65743:42"/>
               <p>But what is that which in the fore-cited Scriptures is forbidden then? Not all mention of idolatrous names, as we have already proved; But either ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by Idols, or praiſing, or approving of them, or maintaining ſuperſtition towards them, or giving ſcandall by them; againſt which wee ſhould bee ſo carefull, as to prevent all ſuſpicion and appearance of that evill, as

               <p>And for the word <hi>Sunday</hi> in particular, though it bee no more idolatrous then the names of other dayes of the week, and ſome moneths of the yeere, it may be the better borne withall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Sunne is not as many Idols are, to which (for want of reall entity out of the fancie) wee may pertinently apply the words of Saint <hi>Paul, An Idol is nothing in the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. for it hath a true, ſolide, and glorious being of its owne,

               <p>Hereto if wee add Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> note upon the text in <hi>Malachy,</hi> the name <hi>Sunday</hi> may bee improved to a more profitable uſe, thus;
<note n="p" place="margin">Orietur <hi>Sol Juſtitiae,</hi> quiverè omnia indicabit, &amp; nec bona nec mala, nec virtutes nec vitia latere patietur. <hi>Hier. in Mal.</hi> 4.2. <hi>tom.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 365. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord, as the Sun, will bring every thing to light, ſo that</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>he will ſuffer neither good nor bad, vertue nor vice any more to lye hid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſay no more for the warrant of this word <hi>Sunday</hi> (for I think I need not) ſave that it hath had the honour to bee many times named in the publick <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of England, and hath beene allowed by divers, who were ſo farre eſtranged from that groſſe Idolatry of the heathens, (in offering up Sacrifice to the Sun) that they offered themſelves to be ſacrificed in the fire for the Sonne of God, rather then they would yeeld to the Idolatry of the Papiſts; for there were of thoſe that approved of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65743:45"/>Booke in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, who ſuffered martyrdome in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary;</hi> and in that Book the name <hi>Sunday</hi> is brought in (in the titles of the Epiſtles and Goſpels) five and twenty ſeverall times in order, without interruption: beſides that, it is mentioned often alſo in other places of the ſame Booke; and with that Book (for this note) agree our Service Books of all editions, in the dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and our Soveraigne that now is.</p>
               <p>And that the name <hi>Sunday</hi> was taken up by them who firſt penned the Communion Book, not as a profane, but as a Scripture name, it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable by this; The Epiſtles and Goſpels in the Communion Booke agree with the ancient Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bible printed in the yeere 1540. (to which Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> prefixed a Preface) and that Tranſlation rendereth Saint <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit upon a</hi> Sunday: So alſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.
<note n="q" place="margin">In Maſter <hi>Tindall</hi> his ſecond edition of his Tranſlation, printed 1540. hee uſeth the ſame word, thus; <hi>Upon ſome</hi> Sunday, &amp;c. 1 Cor. 16.2.</note>

               <p>That which hath beene ſaid on both ſides (if duely conſidered) will ſerve to commend a caveat unto us againſt that fault which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> reproveth, <hi>in making a man an offendor for a word,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65743:45"/>Iſa.</hi> 29.21. either for not ſpeaking of a word, as thoſe who (with ſome ſcruple of conſcience) doe forbeare the name <hi>Sunday,</hi> whom (for Saint <hi>Hieromes,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſake, as before wee have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their Authorities) wee ſhould not too ſharply cenſure: or for ſpeaking of a word, as if men could not name it without ſome ſavour of Pagan ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas, the common people uſe it out of common cuſtome, and without any intention or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of ill; and the wiſer ſort may well bee thought to mention it with an intimation of good, as (out of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>) we have obſerved. And ſo wee will ſhut up all (for this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the name <hi>Sunday</hi>) with a concluſion like that which the Apoſtle maketh concerning the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of meates; <hi>Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth, Rom.</hi> 14.3. So let not him who uſeth the word <hi>Sunday,</hi> deſpiſe him (as fooliſhly preciſe) that uſeth it not: and let not him who uſeth it not, judge him (as careleſly prophane) that uſeth it, ſince, in that ſenſe wherein wee have taken it, there is neither duty nor ſinne, either in the uſe or forbearance of it.</p>

                  <hi>Cardinall</hi> Cajetane, <hi>the Popes Legate in Germany, a man very well read in Divinity, having ſtudied it even from a childe, who, for the happineſſe of his wit, and for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65743:48"/>his laborious diligence, became the prime Divine of that, and many more ages, unto whom there was no Prelate or perſon in the Councell who would not yeeld in learning, or thought himſelfe too good to learne of him. This Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, going Legate into Germany, Anno</hi> 1523. <hi>ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly how thoſe that erred might bee reduced to the Church, found out the true Remedy, which was the literall meaning of the text of Scripture, expounding not the latine Tranſlation, but the Hebrew roots of the old, and the Greeke of the new Teſtament: In which tongues (having no knowledge himſelfe) hee imployed men of underſtanding, who made conſtruction of the text unto him word by word;</hi> as his workes upon the holy books do ſhew.</p>
               <p>Nor was this, or the like note on the names of others any impeachment of the high Commendation given of him before: for mans knowledge was at the beſt when hee ſpake but one tongue; and untill it come to that againe, wee ſhall <hi>know but in part, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and howſoever (ſince the confuſion of tongues) there have been more uſe of verball learning then before, and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had the gift of

               <p>Thirdly, The word <hi>Sabaoth</hi> is in that part of the Booke which is Maſter <hi>N.

               <p>Secondly, For Maſter <hi>Brerewood,</hi> I can ſhew it in a manuſcript of his owne hand, many times ſo lette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it ſhould have beene throughout the Treatiſe, and not once as it is in the miſtaken title.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond point propoſed concerning the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> (for that is the right writing, and wee muſt ſtick to it) is the etymologie of it; wherein, comparing ſome collections of mine owne with what I have met withall ſince, in Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and Doctor <hi>Gomarus</hi> his Inveſtigation of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65743:51"/>
                  <hi>Sabbath,</hi> I finde that, for a good part, wee have all of us light upon the like obſervations, yet without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie or plagiarie dealing with one another: for, though that Booke of Doctor <hi>Gomarus</hi> came forth foure yeers after Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> his Lecture was in print, yet when hee publiſhed the Defence of it two yeere after (ſixe in all) hee had not ſeene it, as in the tenth Chapter of his later Booke, hee

(when our learned Doctor firſt delivered his Lecture of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) I had noted moſt of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the notation of the name, as ſome of good place well know, to whom (upon ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) I imparted them, with other points of this Argument in writing: whereto if I adde any thing of theirs, for which I am beholding to them, I ſhall not bee more ready to make uſe of it, then to give thankes for it, by a reſpective mention of their names: and ſo ſhall I deale with all other Authours, as they ſhall give mee occaſion in the like kinde; yet not doubting, but they may meet with ſome animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of mine, by which (if I borrow ought) they may account themſelves to be paid, and mee ſufficiently quit of that debt.</p>
               <p>The derivations of the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> are foure; (<hi>derivations</hi> I ſay, not <hi>etymologies,</hi> for that word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>right ſpeech;</hi> and moſt of them are wrong) two of them are aliens from the Common-weale of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or at leaſt ſtragglers out of their owne Tribe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65743:52"/>and have no kindred with the ſtock or roote from whence the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> is deduced.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that of <hi>Appion</hi> the Grammarian, againſt whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> wrote two books, which is that of the Egyptian word <hi>Sabbo,</hi> which, as

                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his ſecond Booke againſt <hi>Appion,</hi> it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a diſeaſe in the privie parts: upon which <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> telleth this tale, viz. <hi>That the Jewes, troubled with it in their journey out of Egypt, (for ſixe dayes together) were conſtrained the ſeventh day to reſt; and thereupon, when they came into Judea, they kept an holiday under that name. Juſtine</hi> the Hiſtorian telleth rather the Fable then the Story, in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;

                  <hi>The Egyptians,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>being infected by the Jewes with the ſcab and itch; but (as ſome have it) with the leproſie, were warned (leſt the diſeaſe ſhould ſpread any farther) to drive out</hi> Moſes <hi>and his diſeaſed country-men, who having wandred ſeven dayes in the deſart of Arabia, with much hunger and labour, at mount Sinai obtained an end of both: and therefore there they ſet up the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>as a remembrance of their freedome from famine and wandring: and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the Egyptians, for feare of the infection, lest for that cauſe they ſhould grow odious to other people, they forbad, and forbare communion with them, and by degrees turned their turning out of Egypt into a matter of diſcipline and religion:</hi> So <hi>Juſtine</hi> in the fore-cited place.

               <p>But this was upon their owne ſuperſtition, ſaith hee, and not by precept: and yet hee confeſſeth that there were peculiar ſacrifices for thoſe ſolemnities for which hee quoteth <hi>Num.</hi> 28.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.

Theſe acceptions of the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> have eſpeciall reference to <hi>reſt</hi> from labour.</p>
               <p>The ſecond acception of the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65743:57"/>counting on, the fifth) hath another ſenſe; it is that whereby it is taken for <hi>reſt,</hi> not from <hi>labour,</hi> but from <hi>ſinne:</hi> In this it is frequent among the Fathers of the Church; and well might they call it a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>reſt</hi> in that ſenſe, as in oppoſition to the reſtleſſe turbulencie of ſinne, for that is a very troubleſome evill: the ſinne of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> troubled <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 34.30. the ſinne of <hi>Jonas</hi> troubled the aire, and the ſea, and made it reſtleſſe, untill hee was offered up as a ſacrifice to becalme it; and, <hi>The wicked,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſaiah, are like the troubled ſea, whoſe waves caſt up mire and dirt, Eſa.</hi> 57.20. and though the godly, having leſſe ſinne, have thereby the more reſt; yet to them it is a very troubleſome and toyleſome evill, which will not ſuffer them to ſleepe; <hi>Davids</hi> teares are eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes hereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.6. and for a more ſolide aſſurance of this truth, hee bringeth in his bones to give teſtimony to it, <hi>I finde no reſt in my bones,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>by reaſon of my ſin, Pſal.</hi> 38.3.</p>
               <p>The third acception of the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (but adding it to the former, the ſixth) is that which the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. the word in the originall is not <hi>Sabbatum,</hi> but <hi>Sabbatiſmos;</hi> but the termination troubles not the reſt of the former part of the word, and therefore our beſt Bibles render it (as if it had beene the word <hi>Sabbatum</hi>) by our Engliſh word <hi>Reſt;</hi> and this is the beſt <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Reſt</hi> of all others, wherein the Elect ſhall wholly ceaſe from <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>labour;</hi> and it is that eternall <hi>Sabbath,</hi> whereof the externall or temporall <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a Type (in reſpect of the time of it) as the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle or Temple was a Type (for the place) to the

               <p>But the moſt ſevere Cenſurer of the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (as applyed to the <hi>Lords day</hi>) is the Authour of the Book called <hi>Altare Chriſtianum;</hi> wherein, ſpeaking of him who wrote the Letter to the Vicar of Grantham, hee ſaith,

                  <hi>The Turks, nay, the Indians have their</hi> Sabbaths.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas hee ſaith (as by way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the old <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the Jewes, from that day which Chriſtians celebrate) <hi>that it was memorative of things paſt, and ſigurative of things to come:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That that cannot conſine the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> to

               <p>Fourthly, For that hee ſaith, That the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> is no more morall, and to bee retained in the Church, then the names <hi>Prieſt, Altar,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> wee will him to remember what elſewhere hee hath ſaid, viz.

                  <hi>That there is a reſt which is eternall and morall to all dayes of publick and ſolemne worſhip;</hi> if ſo, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> may bee eternall, and reach as farre as the thing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And whereas hee ſaith, <hi>That</hi> reſt, <hi>to the Jewes, was an eſſentiall dutie,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>of it ſelfe, and in its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without reference or publick worſhip,</hi> which hee denyeth to the Chriſtians weekly holiday: I anſwer, That the queſtion is not here, whether the Jewes were more reſtrained from labour then the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but whether there be not ſo much reſt required now, both in reſpect of publick duties, and of private, (which require alſo ceſſation from outward workes) as that our <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Lords day</hi> hath thereby a better title to the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then <hi>Saturday</hi> hath, which hath been long agoe depoſed from the dignity of an holiday, and made an ordinary workeday.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, For the names <hi>Prieſt, Altar,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> I perſwade my ſelfe he will not deny the name <hi>Prieſt,</hi> ſince hee tooke orders under that name, and doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that name officiate according to the Liturgie of the Church of England, which hee will not ſay is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jewiſh then Chriſtian, Legall then Evangelicall: and for the words <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> I remit him (if hee doubt of them) to bee reſolved by the late Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, wherein both the Names and Things are buſily diſcuſſed: onely I will ſay (by way of anſwer to his compariſon) that ſince wee have a literall <hi>Rest</hi> of a weekly recourſe, and not literall <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> thus may bee retained under the Goſpel, though the names <hi>Prieſt, Altar,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> be aboliſhed.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, The Antecedent is ſubject to exception many wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The chiefe holidayes in the old Teſtament were nominated from the things done, and not from the quality of the perſon to whom they were intended; as the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> from the Angels paſſing over the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Iſraelites in Egypt, without hurt:
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.25.</note> the <hi>feaſt of Trumpets</hi> from the ſolemne ſounding of Trumpets at it:

                  <note place="margin">Levit. 23. Deut. 16.</note> the <hi>feaſt of Tabernacles</hi> from the tents and boothes wherein the people lived in the Deſart: and (which more punctually meets with this objection) their week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holiday had its name, not from him to whom it is dedicated; but from <hi>Reſt,</hi> the duty of the day enjoyned.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65743:63"/>
               <p>Secondly, In the Chriſtian Church, his rule of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination doth not hold, for wee call one holiday dedicated to Chriſt by his <hi>Birth,</hi> another by his <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> another by his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> (which are the things done on the day) not by his name onely to whom they were dedicated.</p>
               <p>If it bee ſaid, when wee ſpeake of the Nativitie, we underſtand the <hi>Birth</hi> of the Lord, and ſo alſo the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> of the Lord, and the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of the Lord; I grant wee doe ſo, and ſo when wee ſay the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> wee may meane (as in the Commandement is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the <hi>Sabbath of</hi> the Lord, or <hi>to</hi> the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the names of dayes ſhould not bee taken from the quality of the perſon onely, to whom they are intended, is plaine by the <hi>feaſt of Pentecoſt,</hi> ſo called from the number of the dayes betwixt it and <hi>Eaſter:</hi> and the name of the <hi>Lords day</hi> called from its order (by the Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>the firſt day of the weeke;</hi> and by the Ancients <hi>the day of light,</hi> from illumination at the Sacrament of <hi>Paptiſme;</hi> and <hi>the day of Bread,</hi> from the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> adminiſtred every <hi>Lords day,</hi> as

               <p>Fourthly, If the names of holidayes ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the quality of the perſon to whom they are intended, as becauſe our weekly holiday is intended to the honour of the Lord, it muſt be called the <hi>Lords day;</hi> then all the holidayes which are named by the Saints, ſhould have their names from their Lord: for, though the portions of Scripture read on them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne their lives and deaths, the honour and ſervice of the day is directed and intended not to them, but to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65743:63"/>the Lord; yea, all holidayes of both Teſtaments are dayes dedicated to his honour; by that reaſon then all muſt bee called the <hi>Lords dayes:</hi> and ſo names that ſhould bee given for diſtinction, would turne to confuſion. Thus much for the firſt Reaſon for the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as applyed to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> which were more then enough, if there had not beene much more then there was need and cauſe objected againſt it; but the reſt we ſhall contract into a narrower compaſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon why our weekly holiday may be called <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> is this:

               <p>That very learned Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> (whoſe Sermons were ſo approved by Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, If they held a myſticall conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Jewes <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and a Chriſtians holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſufficient ground for beſtowing the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> upon a ſpirituall reſt from ſin; it muſt needs bee ſo much more warrantable to call the <hi>Lords day Sabbath,</hi> as there is the more agreement betwixt it and the Jewiſh <hi>Sabbath:</hi> now betwixt them there is an agreement much more then myſticall; for whereas that myſticall <hi>Sabbath</hi> (as the Biſhop taketh it) may bee every day in the weeke, and all the dayes of mans life, our ſolemne <hi>Sabbath</hi> commeth onely once every weeke, as the Jewes <hi>Sabbath</hi> did: In ours wee forbid and forbeare ſecular imployments, ſo was it with the Jewes; there was a ceſſation from ſuch works with them, that they might the better attend upon religious exerciſes, and thoſe principally publick; and ſo it is with us Chriſtians: The reaſon of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawne from Gods example, in his proportion of working ſix dayes, and reſting on the ſeventh is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary to us, as well as to the Jewes: it belongeth to Chriſtians to deale as equally with God, in letting
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65743:82"/>him have one day in ſeven, for his honour who allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us ſixe for one for our owne occaſions) as to the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>And for their end and uſe of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which is a gratefull remembrance of their creation, and the bleſſing of God upon their carefull and holy obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it: wee Chriſtians are as much bound to the one, and may hope for as much benefit by the other, as the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>All which literall conformities conſidered betwixt their <hi>Sabbath</hi> and ours, with reference to the letter of the fourth Commandement, our Church taketh that Commandement wholly into her Liturgy, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (as after the other nine) <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore the diſtinction of literall and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall (to ſay the leaſt of it) is impertinently applyed to preclude the title <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in a literall ſenſe, from the day wee celebrate.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, the Commandement appointeth the proportion of one day in ſeven for ſacred and ſolemne ſervices of Religion, which is as the <hi>Characteriſticon</hi> to the Jewes <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the Chriſtians (which are the variations, into which it is divided) while neither of them is expreſly, and in particular there comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſo that to ſay, the Jewes <hi>Sabbath</hi> is literall, and the Chriſtians onely myſticall, is as if one ſhould ſay, that <hi>Homo</hi> ſignifieth literally a man; but <hi>hominis, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> and <hi>hominem,</hi> note not a man literally, but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. For his aſſertion,
<note n="l" place="margin">The Homily of the time &amp; place of praier. <hi>pag.</hi> 164. <hi>edit.</hi> 1582.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Homily uſeth the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>but in a myſticall and analogicall ſenſe:</hi> the contrary is evident to any intelligent Reader of the Homily: for, ſuch a one may (out of it) deduce theſe literall obſervations:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by the fourth Commandement, Chriſtians muſt have one ſtanding day in a week for the exerciſes of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they muſt reſt upon it after Gods example.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That on that day lawfull workes muſt bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That yet they muſt not be idle, but wholly give themſelves to exerciſes of Gods true Religion and Service.</p>
                  <p>There bee other deductions beſides theſe, which found to the ſame ſenſe; but theſe ſufficiently ſhew, that the Compilers of the Homily tooke the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> not in a meere myſticall ſenſe, but in a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: and herein their Doctrine is conformable to the letter of that Commandement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for his ſimilitude (that our <hi>Lords day</hi> is called <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but as <hi>Mortification</hi> is called <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the circumciſion of the heart,</hi> Rom. 2.29. or as <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> are called <hi>unleavened bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.5. or as <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7.) it is guilty of groſſe diſproportion: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a naturall acception, no two numerall things are more like, then one day is like another; but cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the fleſh, and mortification of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the heart; ſincerity, and unleavened bread; Chriſt and the Paſſover, though in ſome reſpects ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable (as the Kingdome of heaven and a graine of
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.31.</note>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:65743:84"/>muſtard ſeed) are yet in their kinds at very great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: for, <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is an act of the hand, <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> an act, or rather an habit wrought by the ſpirit upon the mind: <hi>unleavened bread</hi> is a viſible ſubſtance, <hi>ſincerity</hi> an inviſible quality; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a moſt excellent perſon, conſiſting of a divine and humane nature; the <hi>Paſſover</hi> an action literally, <hi>the Angels paſsing over the doores which were ſprinckled with the bloud of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchall Lambe:</hi> which (after the Angell) was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly (yet figuratively) applyed to the Lambe it ſelfe; and afterward (by another figure more remote from the letter, and ſo more myſticall) our Saviour was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Paſſover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if wee take the two dayes in a religious (as well as in a naturall) acception, there is much more conformity betwixt them, then betwixt the termes of the Biſhops compariſon, ſo much that the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> may bee literall to them both, though (in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) one part be purely myſticall, and analogicall.</p>
                  <p>For (to ſay nothing of other conformities foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) it may ſuffice to make them both partakers of the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (which ſignifieth Reſt) that reſt, or ceſſation from ſecular labours, was on the one, and is required and obſerved on the other: wherein the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage now reſts upon the part of our Chriſtian <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> ſince that is ſtill, and will be to the worlds end a day of religious reſt: and the Jewes day, though it were ſo from the beginning, was many an hundred years ago degraded from the dignity of a weekly Holiday, and made a work-day, and ſo ſhall be, untill our temporall <hi>Sabbath</hi> on earth, be changed into the eternall <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> in heaven, which the Apoſtle promiſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Before there aroſe a controverſie in our Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>or (at leaſt wiſe) before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie grew to an height, Divines ſpake and writ more freely, and they were not alwayes ſo cautelous &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, as to foreſee the evill conſtruction which the adverſaries of the truth might make of their writing and ſpeaking: but now, when the Sabbatarian hereſie for neceſſary obſervation of the old</hi> Sabbath, <hi>and a fanaticall opinion of ſome others, for the obſervation of the</hi> Lords day, <hi>in a more preciſe forme then the very Judaicall Law it ſelfe, obliged the Jewes to keepe the old</hi> Sabbath; <hi>when, I ſay, theſe errours ſprang up, and were

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, if upon evidence of truth,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>wee ſhall in ſome paſſages diſſent from ſome men of note, living in this Church before us, or uſe other termes in our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or diſputing; nay, if we ſhould in ſome things have altered our owne former opinion, and formes of ſpeaking, wee truſt that godly Chriſtians will not impute this unto us as an offence, but in their charity will judge of us, as the ancient Church did of Saint</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>to wit, that what wee doe in this kinde, proceedeth from the care wee have, in a faire and perſpicuous manner to maintaine and defend the truth.</hi> Thus farre the Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>I have ſet downe his exception at large, becauſe I meane to make a full anſwer to it: for that purpoſe three particulars are eſpecially to be obſerved in this the ſaying of the Biſhop:</p>
                  <p>The firſt, Of the ancient Fathers unwary writings before hereſies aroſe; which is true, but not to the purpoſe: for none that reads them at the firſt hand, unleſſe hee bring with him a violent impreſſion of prejudice againſt the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> will conceive one ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in them to ſound to that ſenſe which the Biſhop intendeth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, His application thereof to the <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie</hi> controverſies; which is to the purpoſe: but (as hee ſtates the difference) not true.</p>
                  <p>The third is a requeſt for charitable conſtruction, which, in regard of the ſecond, he hath need of: We need ſay nothing of the firſt, and for the ſecond, it may be ſaid,</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:65743:85"/>
                  <p>Firſt, that though ſome have exceeded in ſeverity, both for the doctrine and practice of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (and yet I accompt not all to bee exceſſive, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop approveth not) many have much more exceeded in looſneſſe and profaneneſſe; which is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the actors, and more ſcandalous to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their exceſſes: and there was more need, that all the Biſhops of the Land ſhould oppoſe this, then that he ſhould ſet upon that in ſuch ſort as he did.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that he ſaith of the Sabbatarian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, for the neceſſary obſervation of the old <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the way to withſtand it, is not (as he doth) to take the title <hi>Sabbath</hi> from the <hi>Lords day;</hi> and to ſhift it from the firme ground of the fourth Commandement, and to make it ſtand ſo much upon meere tradition as hee doth: nay, ſo to give up that both title and text (as hee hath done) to the old <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is to confirme, rather then to confute the <hi>Sabbathary</hi> errour; which (by his manner of handling the matter) neither is, nor can be ſoundly convinced as it ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whoſoever will adviſedly reade and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what hath been lately written concerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> will find as great cauſe to give caution againſt Anti-ſabbathary, as Sabbathary errours. And though the Biſhop pretend the errour of the old <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and rigour of the new, to have been (ſo new, that Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> could not take notice of it, being before their time; and that therefore they tooke the leſſe heed to their termes, when they ſpake of our Chriſtian and Weekly Holiday:) yet it is not like, that either was unknowne unto them (as he ſaith the hereſie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> was to <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65743:86"/>when they wrote ſomewhat uncircumſpectly, concerning ſome points which he perverted.)</p>
                  <p>For, the conceipt of the neceſſity, and perpetuity of the <hi>Saturday Sabbath,</hi> hath bin the hereſie of all Jewes, and of ſome Chriſtians, ever ſince the Chriſtian <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> was ordained; and the moſt rigorous exceſſes, touching the obſervation of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in a
<note n="n" place="margin">M <hi>Rogers</hi> Prefat. to the Art. of Relig. printed <hi>anno</hi> 1607.</note> Booke of generall note, and common uſe, before the paſſages, cited out of Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> writings, were publiſhed by himſelfe, or any one elſe; at leaſt before his Starre-chamber ſpeech againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Traske</hi> was made: and in that ſpeech, though <hi>Traske</hi> were Jewiſhly conceipted of the <hi>Saturday Sabbath,</hi> he gives the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as hath been noted: and even Doctor <hi>Howſon</hi> Biſhop of Durham, though (in his Sermon of Feſtivities) hee mention the ſame ſtraines of ever-ſtrained ſeverity, in obſervation of the Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath,</hi> calleth <hi>Sunday,</hi> or the <hi>Lords day</hi> (for all that) by the name <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the wiſer ſort well knew, that to prejudice the piety and authority of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as from the fourth Commandement (from whence the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> is derived upon it) would bee to give too much countenance to <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Antinomiſts,</hi> whoſe hereſie being plauſible to the fleſh, by the craft of the Divell, was like to find more welcome entertainment with the world, then that opinion of the <hi>Saturday Sabbath,</hi> or then thoſe extreme ſeverities in obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Lords day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that all doubts and dangers duely conſidered on both ſides, I make no doubt, if moſt of thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, whoſe teſtimonies wee have produced (for the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65743:86"/>name <hi>Sabbath</hi>) were now alive, to ſee the carriage of the cauſe in our daies; but they would thinke it moſt convenient, to continue the title <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> to make good their precedent, by ſubſequent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations to this truth: and to adde their further care, to oppoſe profaneneſſe, which hath mightily advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſince the Legall and Evangelicall authority, and piety of this day hath been ſo oppoſed: I may ſay in the Biſhops owne words (and with reference to him) oppoſed <hi>with an high hand:</hi> for no hand ſo high as his, did ever ſtrive ſo to weaken the one, and darken the other (ſince the darkneſſe of Popery, was by the light of the Goſpel, driven out of our Engliſh Horizon) as his hath done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, yet for all that (as he deſires) I will judge charitably of him: for, my charity inclines mee to conceive, that he wrote what he thought; but withall, my diſcretion telleth me, that his pen marched (in this quarrell) after <hi>Jehu</hi>'s pace, in ſome pangs of paſſion (which are no helps to true information in any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, whether of Religion, or otherwiſe) elſe hee would not have ſtained his ſtile with ſuch infected phraſes, as [

                  <head>The fourth exception of the Biſhop, touching the teſtimony of his Brother, Doctor <hi>John White,</hi> anſwered.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, for that which is brought in in the name of his brother Doctor <hi>John White,</hi> calling the <hi>Lords day</hi> by the name of <hi>Sabbath,</hi> he replyeth thus: <hi>There is not any contradiction between the two brethren in this Doctrine: for, the one brother calleth the</hi> Lords day, Sabbath, <hi>in a myſticall ſenſe; and the other brother ſaith, that it is not the</hi> Sabbath <hi>of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a literall and proper ſenſe.</hi> Where he bringeth in againe the diſtinction of <hi>literall</hi> and <hi>myſticall,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>literall</hi> in a negative ſenſe for his owne part (for he denieth the name in that ſenſe) and giving <hi>myſticall</hi> in a poſitive acception (but with an implicite negation of the letter) to his brother: to which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that had Doctor <hi>John White</hi> been alive, when the Biſhop wrote thus, he could not (I beleeve) have made him ſuch a yonger brother (though hee were the elder brother, and a Biſhop both) as to put upon him his opinions of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> either for the title or tenure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the miſt of that miſ-application of <hi>myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> and <hi>literall,</hi> is already diſpelled by the expoſition of the Homily, which containeth the Tenet of the Church of England; ſo that we may ſay, ſuppoſing his brother an Orthodox Doctor of this Church, hee did not (howſoever he ſhould not) ſo take the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> in a myſticall ſenſe, as to deny the literall, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the <hi>Lords day.</hi>

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:65743:87"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, by that I have heard of that learned and godly Doctor, both for his Doctrine, where he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and for his converſation, where he lived, I have cauſe to ſuſpect his brother impoſeth an opinion on him, which he did not hold, as he did on our Churches Homily, before rehearſed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whoſoever ſhall pleaſe to peruſe the
<note n="p" place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> quotation out of Doctor <hi>John Whites</hi> Booke, ſhall evidently ſee, that he tooke the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> not in a myſticall, but in a literall ſenſe, and without abſurd and perverſe wreſtling of his words they cannot otherwiſe be expounded.</p>

               <p>WHat before wee have obſerved (by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt the word <hi>Sabbath</hi>) was onely to note how farre (by ſome) it was diſliked; now wee muſt particularly examine the grounds and reaſons of their diſlike, and give anſwer to them; though ſome of them be rather paſſionate reproaches, then probable objections.</p>
               <p>Here the clamours of Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> are ſo
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65743:88"/>loud, that hee muſt needs firſt be heard with his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt the word <hi>Sabbath:</hi> which, if they be as true, as they are hainous, juſt cauſe there is to decree downe, and cry down the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as the name of him, who (to bee famous) burned the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at Epheſus; and thereupon, became ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that all mention of his name was forbidden by a ſolemne Decree. His charge, on the uſe of the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is, <hi>That there is in it a double plot: the
<note n="a" place="margin">Doct. <hi>Pockl.</hi> Viſit. Serm. <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</note> one is, to ſtalke behind that name, and to ſhoot at the ſervice appointed for the</hi> Lords day; <hi>the
<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> other is, to impoſe upon the day damnable ſuperſtition;</hi> which hee aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates, by this opprobrious compariſon: hee

                  <hi>If we find the word</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <hi>for</hi> Sunday (ſaith he) <hi>uſed in ſome writings, that of late come unto our hands, blame not the Clerks, good men, for it: Nor entitle the miſpriſion any higher, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then to theſe pretenders of piety, who (for their own ends) have for a long time deceived the world with their zealous, and moſt ignorant, or cunning clamours, and rung the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>ſo commonly into all mens eares, that not Clerkes onely, but men of judgement, learning, and vertue, not heeding (peradventure ſo much as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite)
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65743:88"/>what crafty and wicked device may be managed under the vaile of a faire word uſed in Gods Law, doe likewiſe ſuffer the name often to eſcape the doore of their lips, that deteſt the drift of the deviſer in the cloſet of their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which ſpeech (to ſpare many other paſſages of his booke, which lye open to juſt exception of reaſon and religion) there are divers particulars, worthy of examination and cenſure, which we may referre,</p>
               <p>Firſt, to the fault objected, <hi>an impious</hi> plot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to the perſons, for whom he putteth in a perplexed and impotent plea, to acquit or excuſe them from participation therein.</p>
               <p>For the former, <hi>(viz. the plot)</hi> it is twofold (as hee takes it) the one, to ſtalke behind the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and to ſhoot at the ſervice appointed for the <hi>Lords day:</hi> the other, to impoſe upon the day damnable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Let him remember what hee hath ſaid <hi>page</hi> 7. viz.

                  <hi>Allow them their</hi> Sabbath, <hi>and you muſt allow them the ſervice that belongs to their</hi> Sabbath; <hi>then muſt you have no Letany, for thats no ſervice for their</hi> Sabbaths, <hi>but for</hi> Sundayes. To which I ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Hee ſeemeth to except againſt a Sabbatary ſervice, as faulty or offenſive in ſome poſitive points; but noteth nothing in particular but what is negative, <hi>the leaving out of the Letany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That thoſe whom wee have produced for the uſe of the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> require no Jewiſh ſervices on that day, nor any other then ſuch as the Church hath eſtabliſhed under the name <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65743:89"/>
               <p>Thirdly, That if the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> will ſerve for a ſtalking horſe againſt the <hi>Letany,</hi> and other ſervice of the Church, becauſe that is enjoyned not under the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but <hi>Sunday;</hi> then the word <hi>Lords day,</hi> (which hee alloweth) will ſerve as well for a ſtalking horſe to the ſame purpoſe; for the Service is entituled not with the name [<hi>Lords day</hi>], but with the name <hi>Sunday;</hi> which (as wee have obſerved before) is the word that beareth the greateſt ſound and ſway throughout all the Communion Books ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion within this Realme: yea the title <hi>Lords day</hi> will ſerve better to that purpoſe; for the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is incorporated into the ſervice of the Church in the fourth Commandement (where that title <hi>Sabbath</hi> is repeated thrice over) and that Commandement, with the other nine, is appointed by the order of our Church, to bee rehearſed (in her publick Liturgie) every <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>holiday:</hi> and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them) on the fifth of November, and on the dayes of ſolemne faſting, preſcribed upon eſpeciall occaſion of the Church and State, and to bee learned by heart by the younger ſort, as a part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Catechiſme: but the name <hi>Lords day</hi> is not (to my remembrance) once mentioned in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Book now in uſe.</p>
               <p>Now for the other plot, <hi>It is,</hi> as hee ſaith, <hi>to impoſe upon the day damnable ſuperstition.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p>That the day may lawfully be called by that name, as before wee have proved; the abuſe of it in ſome (if it were ſuch as hee pretended, but cannot prove) cannot take away the Chriſtian liberty of others for the lawfull uſe of it; nor hinder, but that good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65743:89"/>may have their intentions (when they uſe it) truely pious, though the mindes of others bee ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this condemning cenſure of an harmeleſſe word (in
<note n="f" place="margin">Peccar, qui damnat quaſi peccata, quae nulla ſunt. <hi>Aug. de lib. arb. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</note> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is a ſinne, and that ſinne may bee a ſevere and ſowre ſuperſtition: for there is a ſuperſtition <hi>negative,</hi> as well as <hi>poſitive</hi> (as in thoſe who ſay, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not, Col.</hi> 2.21.) The forbearance of a thing as unlawfull when it is lawfull, is a ſuperſtition; and the damning of ſuch a thing may bee a damnable ſuperſtition; but howſoever, ſaith the Doctor, it is a great <hi>indecorum</hi> to call the <hi>Lords day</hi> by the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:
<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>D. Pockl. p.</hi> 20.</note> The vizzard of the</hi> Sabbath <hi>on the face of the</hi> Lords day, ſaith he, <hi>doth as well become it, as the crowne of thornes did the Lord himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſpeech not ſit to be delivered for ſhame, without a vizzard on the face of him that ſpeaketh it, to hide his bluſhing at the guilt of ſuch an exceſſive abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if hee have any modeſty at all, or to cover his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, if hee have none.</p>
               <p>Here (by the way) let him not thinke it much, if we returne him a taſte of <hi>rue,</hi> or <hi>herbe grace,</hi> for his full dos of <hi>vinegar and gall:</hi> for what <hi>indecorum</hi> can bee conceived comparable to that of ſetting of a crowne of thornes upon his head who was ſo innocent and excellent, that roſes, and the powder of gold were not good enough to bee ſtrewed in his way, nor worthy to be trodden on by the ſandals of his feet?</p>
               <p>Surely, if there had beene an appearance of ſuch uncomelineſſe in calling the <hi>Lords day</hi> by the name of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> ſo pregnant in apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65743:90"/>ſo ſound in judgement, and the learned Biſhops, with other Eccleſiaſticks of eſpeciall choice, who were at the conference of Hampton Court, would not have ſhewed an unanimous aſſent to the thing Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> propoſed, which was the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of abuſe of the</hi> Lords day, by the name of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> without any exception at the word uſed by him.</p>
               <p>But indeed, there was no cauſe of offence in it at all, for want of comelineſſe (as Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> objecteth) for the comelineſſe of words chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in their congruity with the things to which they are applyed; and betwixt the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> and the <hi>Lords day</hi> there is that congruity, for that word ſignifieth <hi>reſt,</hi> and the <hi>Lords day</hi> is a day of <hi>reſt;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſuch ſtrict <hi>reſt</hi> as the Jewes <hi>Sabbath</hi> was, is a Queſtion not now to be diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>Now, if Maſter Doctor like his owne reſemblance, let him take the conſequence of his odious compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is, <hi>That it is as comely, or not more uncomely to put a crowne of thornes upon the head of Chriſt, then to call the</hi> Lords day <hi>by the name of</hi> Sabbath day, and then hee may joyne hands, and hold ſociety (for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes) with them; or rather, bee the Ringleader to them in ſuch abſurd ſimilitudes unto them, who match in malignity and guilt,
<note n="h" place="margin">They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſolve whether the ſinne bee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bowle, ſhoot, or dance on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> then to commit murther, or the Father to cut the throat of his owne childe: all which doubts will ſoone bee reſolved by plucking off the vizzard of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> from the face of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which doth as well and truly become it, as the crowne of thornes did the Lord himſelfe. <hi>D.

                  <hi>bowling, ſhooting, or dancing on the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>with the commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the perſons for whom he ſeemeth to plead, and put in an excuſe, ſaying, <hi>If wee find the word</hi> Sabbath <hi>for</hi> Sunday <hi>uſed in ſome writings that of late came to our hands, blame not the Clerkes, good men, for it, &amp;c.</hi> It would be knowne</p>
               <p>Firſt, whom hee calleth theſe <hi>good men,</hi> whether Clerkes, or others (for his words are ambiguous.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether hee take the word <hi>Clerkes</hi> for <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> or for ſuch onely as tranſcribe the Dictats of others; if of theſe (as it ſeemeth he doth) then</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how hee knoweth, that in ſuch late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (as have the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> for <hi>Sunday,</hi> or the <hi>Lords day</hi>) the Clerkes, who copied them out, miſtook the Authors mind and hand, ſo much as to write the one for the other, there being no ſuch vicinity in the words, as might lead them to ſuch a miſpriſion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whether it bee not more likely, that the word might drop from the Authors pens, as well as it did often eſcape the lips (as he confeſſeth) of ſuch as he commends for men of judgement, learning, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, rather then that theſe <hi>Clerkes, good men</hi> (as hee calls them) ſhould corrupt their manuſcripts in their tranſcription.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, how is it probable, that a few pretenders to piety ſhould ſo long deceive the world with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous clamours of the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> (men of judgment, learning, and vertue, not excepted) as hee pretendeth eſpecially, ſince (as he ſaith) they were moſt ignorant clamours: hee addeth (I grant) [<hi>or cunning</hi>] <hi>clamours;</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:65743:91"/>but how ignorance and cunning (being ſo contrary) ſhould ſo indifferently bee diſpoſed, to produce the ſame effect in men of judgement; and why ignorant clamours ſhould not as much withhold from aſſent unto them, as cunning clamours induce them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort with them, is that which my ſhallowneſſe cannot conceive, and his wiſdome, I thinke, will not bee able to manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, how could hee come to know, that theſe whom hee exempteth from ſociety in this <hi>Sabbathary ſtratagem,</hi> ſhould deteſt the drift of the deviſers in the cloſet of their hearts, ſince not hee, nor any (but God onely) hath the key of that cloſet; and if they did ſo, how could they have the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (whereby it is advanced) ſo frequently in their mouthes? If they knew it not, how could they deteſt it? If they did know it, how could they (being ſuch men of judgment as hee taketh them for) ſo familiarly uſe it, without feare of ſcandall, or danger by it?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, how could ſo many reverend and learned men, Prelates, Deanes, and other Doctors, or theſe men of judgement, learning, and vertue (
<note n="i" place="margin">Men of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zue, not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps, what crafty and wicked device may be managed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vaile of a faire word. <hi>Doct.

(when as hee feignes it was firſt ſet on foot) apprehended it, until this Doctor made diſcovery of ſuch a dangerous plot, and (withall) of their dulneſſe who all the while could not diſcerne it? <hi>Pardon me (good Sir) if I beleeve they were ſo wiſe and watchfull over the ſafety of the publicke ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, and the purity of Religion, as to give
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65743:91"/>due warning againſt ſuch damnable ſuperſtition. If there had been any ſuch danger in the uſe of the word</hi> Sabbath, <hi>as you ſeeme to conceive, they would not have left the honour of that diſcovery, and caution to you: much leſſe would they have uſed the word themſelves (as they have done) whereto they were not induced by the Clamours of the pretenders of piety (as
<note n="k" place="margin">Doct. <hi>Pockl pag.</hi> 21.</note> you pretend) but rather in all likelihood, by the fourth Commandement it ſelfe, by the Liturgie of the Church (requiring that to bee ſaid, as a part of divine Service, and to be learned by heart, as a part of the Catechiſme, as before was obſerved) wherein all her children, by her preſcription, are to be inſtructed and examined; from hence might the word</hi> Sabbath <hi>be a name of vulgar uſe, for our weekly Holiday, and not from the noiſe which ſuch men have rung in the eares of all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, if a man ſhould returne to Maſter Doctor ſome of his own language, and ſay, <hi>No ancient Father, no learned man, Heathen, or Chriſtian, ever imagined ſuch a plot or myſtery of iniquity, to lye hid under the name</hi> Sabbath, <hi>before the yeare</hi> 1554. <hi>yea not one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelfe (and yet one beſides himſelfe were the likeſt to light upon ſuch fantaſtick Bugbeares) from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, untill the day and yeare of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Viſitation Sermon at Ampthill, Auguſt</hi> 17. 1635. <hi>ever found out, or feigned ſuch a dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in the uſe of that word, as hee hath invented in his ſtudy, or elſewhere, and vented in the Pulpit, and ſince made publicke by the preſſe:</hi> I am conſident he cannot give one Inſtance to confute it, nor name one man, who may be thought to lead him to it; and I hope, he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65743:92"/>will find no more to follow him in his ſtrange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſurmiſes.</p>
               <p>And may not a man cry quittance with him in it, by taking a liberty to imagine, <hi>that he (who</hi> ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveigheth againſt the name <hi>Sabbath) had a plot therein, to ſhake the foundation of the</hi> Lords day, <hi>which (as it is a weekly day of Reſt) reſteth on the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; to ſlacken, if not to breake the bond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the duties of the day, and to make way for more living, and leſſe labour, to heap up Benefices, and ſhrinke in the ſervices due to the Lord of the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>and to the ſoules of the people on that day, to give them leave to turne a Chriſtian Holiday into a profane play-day, that his paines may be leſſe looked for at his Paſtor all charge, and his negligence the leſſe blamed, when hee is abſent from it, or idle at it? And if a man reade his booke over, and give way to the working of his imagination, as hee hath done, may hee not haply thinke, that by his ſetting upon the name</hi> Sabbath, <hi>his plot was to proſtitute the dignity of that day to ſuch profanation, as might bee a preparation to Popiſh ſuperſtition? for, if ever Popery (like the uncleane ſpirit) return to the place whence it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, the common breach of the fourth Commandement by violation of the</hi> Sabbath <hi>will be, if not a wide gate, yet at leaſt an open wicket, or window to receive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi> For, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obſerveth well, though hee apply it ill,

               <p>THe next Exception to bee anſwered againſt the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is the Quaere, and a Dilemma of <hi>Barkley</hi> the Papiſt, in his <hi>Parenaeſis ad Sectar.</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence by the Tranſlator of Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> his Lecture, and by him called a <hi>notable Dilemma
<note n="a" place="margin">The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prid.</hi> Lectine, in Epiſt. to the Reader, <hi>p. ult.</hi> but in <hi>Barkley</hi> his <hi>Paraeneſ. ad Sectar.</hi> it is <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 161.</note>; What is the cauſe,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that many of our Sectaries call this day</hi> (meaning the Chriſtian weekely Holiday) <hi>by the name of</hi> Sabbath? <hi>If they obſerve it,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>as a</hi> Sabbath, <hi>they muſt obſerve it becauſe God reſted on that day; and then they ought to keepe that day wherein God reſted, and not the firſt (as now they doe) wherein the Lord began his labours. If they obſerve it as the day of our Saviours Reſurrection, why doe they call it ſtill the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>ſeeing that Christ did not altogether reſt, but valiantly overcame the power of death?</hi> To which I anſwer;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, That not onely Sectaries, but prudent and potent Kings, reverend and learned Biſhops, and other orthodox Divines, have allowed of the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> for the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as the Teſtimonies premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſufficiently ſhew.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the Dilemma, it is an abſurd imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency to the point in queſtion; for the Queſtion is of the <hi>appellation,</hi> and the Dilemma is made of the <hi>obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> yet (as if it were not a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65743:93"/>ſquint-eyed and diſtorted Argument, but looked di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the title) I anſwer</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the firſt part of it, that to call a day <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> there is no neceſſity it ſhould bee the ſame day on which God reſted; for the name is given to it, not onely becauſe of Gods example of <hi>reſt,</hi> but alſo becauſe of his ordinance of <hi>reſt;</hi> for if he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted himſelfe, but onely inſtituted a day of <hi>reſt,</hi> ſuch a day might ſignificantly and ſutably be called by ſuch a name, as wee have obſerved. The Holidayes of the Jewes were ſo called (beſides the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of weekly recourſe); yet is not God ſaid to have reſted on them, nor did hee, for they were dayes of worke both to him, and to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of it is, <hi>If they obſerve it as the day of our Saviours Reſurrection, why doe they call it ſtill the</hi> Sabbath; <hi>ſeeing eſpecially that Chriſt did not altogether reſt, but valiantly overcame the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of death?</hi> Which words are liable to the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions as the former: for the Reſurrection contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the nature of the Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but the occaſion of it; nor is the day called <hi>Sabbath</hi> from Chriſts example and practice on that day, but from Chriſtians reſting from their ſecular affaires, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, gratefull, and ſolemne memoriall thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is called <hi>Sabbath,</hi> with reference to the Creation, which was finiſhed in ſixe dayes, and Gods <hi>reſt</hi> on the ſeventh; and to our duty to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our ſecular affaires in the like number of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dayes, and after them to reſt as God did after his workes: but with reference to the Reſurrection, it is called, not <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> but <hi>Lords day,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65743:93"/>on that day the Lord of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſhewed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Dominion over the Divell, death, and the grave, in breaking their bonds, and riſing up (in deſpigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of their power) when they had him at their greateſt advantage, being under their Arreſt.</p>
               <p>And, for that hee faith our Saviour did not reſt on the day of his Reſurrection, wee may ſay with
<note n="b" place="margin">See B. <hi>White</hi> his examinat. of the Dialog. <hi>pag.</hi> 110, 111, 113.</note> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>White,</hi> and his
<note n="″" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Adverſary alſo (for therein they are not adverſaries, but agree well together) that <hi>though he were in action, yet did he not labour;</hi> for his glorifyed body had that ability and perfection in it, that all motions and actions were as pleaſing to it as any eaſe or reſt could be; and not onely that day, but all the dayes betwixt the Reſurrection and Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee was converſant in Sabbatary or ſanctified employment, <hi>ſpeaking of the things appertaining to the Kingdome of God for forty daies together, Act.</hi> 1.3. and though hee did not reſt (nor needed it as wee doe) yet wee muſt. And if we may call the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> though wee take it before dinner, as Chriſt did not; wee may call our day <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſince we reſt, though he did not.</p>
               <p>So this notable <hi>Dilemma,</hi> brought in with its two hornes, againſt the two ſyllables of the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> hath not defaced one letter, but left it entire for a title of the <hi>Lords day;</hi> and <hi>Barkley</hi> hath but barked at it, not bitten it, to doe it any manner of hurt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The compariſon hath two parts; The ground of it; and the inconformity betwixt <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Sunday,</hi> which hee maketh to bee as much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> and no more.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Hee ſaith the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is a proper name, as <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> are: which is not true; for <hi>Sabbath</hi> is rather a name of office, as <hi>King;</hi> then a proper name, as <hi>Edward,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>Charles;</hi> and therefore any day of religious <hi>rest,</hi> what day of the weeke ſoever it fell, was called a <hi>Sabbath:</hi> and ſo may the <hi>Lords day</hi> bee much more, becauſe it ſucceeds the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the old Teſtament, as a weekely day of <hi>rest</hi> (as that was, and other holidayes were not) and exceeds it too, in as much as the occaſion of it, and motive to obſerve it is doubled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For his compariſon, ſaying, <hi>That it is as great confuſion to call</hi> Sunday Sabbath, <hi>as to call</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:65743:94"/>Sunday Saturday, hee will make it good, when he can prove, that the <hi>Sun</hi> and

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, If that were true, it maketh nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: for, wee apply it to a ſeventh day now, and to none elſe, though not to that ſeventh day, which was at firſt obſerved; and if hee ſay, that the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and that ſeventh day, which was <hi>Saturday,</hi> cannot bee ſeparated (which is indeed his meaning) I ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> may bee communicable to other dayes, though it were not ſeparable from the <hi>Saturday:</hi> for, if the day had never been changed, yet other daies agreeing with it in ceſſation from worke, might, and did partake with it in the appellation of Reſt.

               <p>Secondly, I ſay the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> from the Creation, are ſeparable: for, if <hi>Saturday</hi>

               <p>Beſides, our Church commandeth (with the reſt of the Decalogue) the reading of the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for ſanctification; and this weekly, with a prayer for pardon of profanation paſt, and for grace

               <p>Thirdly, to deny the name of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the day wee Chriſtians celebrate, is rather Jewiſh: for, thoſe that are Jewes indeed, or Jewiſh in opinion (as

<note n="o" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>whereto</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I may adde the Jewes reckoning of the dayes of the weeke;</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday <hi>they call</hi> Sabbath day, Sunday <hi>they call the firſt day of the</hi> Sabbath, Munday <hi>the ſecond of the</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, &amp;c. In which accompt (ſaith he) no day is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sabbath</hi> but <hi>Saturday;</hi> nor can the Jewes, or thoſe that are Jewiſh, abide to have the <hi>Lords day</hi> to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sabbath,</hi> becauſe they would exclude it from all right and title to the fourth Commandement, as is plaine enough, by that wee have already noted out of Maſter <hi>Brab.</hi> and therefore that of

That a Jew ſhould bee the Godfather, and give it the name</hi> Sabbath (as hee ſaith) is a fancie, which both ſuperſtitious Jewes, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians, will deny and deride.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let thoſe that thinke to call the Chriſtian weekly Holiday by the name of <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is Jewiſh, conſider, whether it bee not now either Jewiſh or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, to call <hi>Saturday</hi> by that name, rather then the <hi>Lords day,</hi> ſince <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſignifieth Reſt; and to ſay, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> muſt now be a day of Reſt, is Jewiſh: and if it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65743:96"/>bee a workeday (as wee take it) to entitle it with a name ſo contrary to work, is little leſſe then fooliſh: eſpecially, ſince wee have a day of <hi>reſt,</hi> to which that name, with more congruity may be applyed.</p>
               <p>For now to give <hi>Saturday</hi> (a workeday with us) that name of <hi>reſt,</hi> and to deny it to the <hi>Lords day</hi> (wherein wee reſt indeede) is as if wee ſhould call the body of a deceaſed King by the name of a King, and deny that Royall title to the living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſurviving Sonne and heire, the heire of his Crowne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, For that which Maſter <hi>Ironſide</hi> ſaith, of gratifying the Jewes by applying the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> to ours <hi>Lords day,</hi> and of their abhorring of the title <hi>Lords day,</hi> as the greateſt blaſphemy: I anſwer,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, This objection, if it have any weight in it, maketh more againſt the reading of the fourth Commandement in our Communion Book, and the Prayer annexed to it (for inclination of the heart to keep that Law,) then againſt the ſimple name or title <hi>Sabbath;</hi> for there is much more conformity with the Jewes in that, then in this; eſpecially, as ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Commandement, with particular limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to the Saturday <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and whether it reach not alſo (in part) to prohibite the publick rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſome parts of Canonicall Scripture, I will not determine.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:65743:98"/>
               <p>Secondly, If any apply any place to our weekly holiday, which is peculiar to the Jewes <hi>Sabbath,</hi> he may as eaſily be anſwered by diſtinction of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath;</hi> as if from the name [<hi>Altar</hi>] (much in uſe with ſome in our dayes) any ſhould make inferences of Jewiſh Sacrifices to bee offered upon it: hee may bee ſtopped (which the Authour of this objection I thinke will not deny) by the diſtinction of a Jewiſh and Chriſtian <hi>Altar,</hi> and application ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To diſavow the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> would become a more dangerous ſnare to Judaiſme; for that were to give up the fourth Commandement wholly unto the Jewes, both for title and tenure, (for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the title how can our Chriſtian Holiday be in any good ſenſe ſet upon that ground?) and to eſtabliſh their day by the beſt Authority that can bee, <hi>viz.,</hi> by a moſt holy and expreſſe law, as the Jewes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and ſome Chriſtians too eaſily aſſent: And to leave our <hi>Lords day</hi> floting upon the uncertaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of an Apoſtolicall tradition, as ſome account it: <hi>Who can tell,</hi> ſaith

               </p>
               <p>This (as I have
<note n="e" place="margin">In my hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall part of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </note> ſhewed) was a ſnare and ſcandall to M. <hi>Braburne,</hi> which made him relapſe from <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> to <hi>Saturday.</hi> And if his Books were as commonly read as they are cunningly penned to this purpoſe, many more might bee taken in that ſnare at unawares,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65743:98"/>unleſſe they were more ſoundly anſwered then yet they have been.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There is a ſnare to profaneneſſe, as well as to Judaiſme to bee ſhunned by Chriſtians; but the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> from the <hi>Lords day</hi> (as thoſe that moſt diſlike that title would have it) may bee a ſnare to profaneneſſe, and that in a higher degree, then the Judaiſme pretended: for they that moſt miſlike the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as applyed to <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Lords day,</hi> diſavow both the honour and holineſſe of the day, and would depoſe it from being a Queene, to make it a drudge, an ordinary workeday; and therefore with the name, they deny its right to the fourth Commandement, as the uncommunicable charter of a weekely holiday in the Jewiſh Church; whence will follow, that many will be more bold fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to profane it: Therefore, in this reſpect alſo, there is more danger in refuſing or forbearing the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (when we ſpeak of our day of religious reſt) then in receiving or approving thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 7. Though Maſter <hi>Braburne</hi> accompt it too great an honour to the <hi>Lords day</hi> (as before wee have noted) to bee called <hi>Sabbath:</hi> yet the Chriſtian Church hath obſerved ſome matter of reproach in it; and therefore hath ſhee called a ſort of Heretickes, by way of contempt and cenſure [<hi>Sabbatarii;</hi>] and it is a ready reproach, in the mouthes of many, to call them, as in diſdaine, <hi>Sabbatharians,</hi> who put the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> upon <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true: but firſt the Church condemneth them not for calling and holding the <hi>Lords day</hi> to bee a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but <hi>Saturday;</hi> as the Ebionites did of old,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65743:99"/>and Maſter <hi>Brab.</hi> of late, and the Jewes doe to this day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though Heretickes have been ſo entitled from the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and ſome (who are not Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes) be too forward to caſt that terme in contempt upon their Orthodox brethren; yet the word is never the worſe, or leſſe honourable for that: for, there were Heretickes called

<note n="i" place="margin">Doct. <hi>Pockl.</hi> Serm. <hi>Sunday no Sabb. p.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>No learned man, Heathen nor Chriſtian, tooke the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>otherwiſe then for</hi> Saturday, <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, till the beginning of Schiſme, which was</hi> 1554.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Maſter <hi>Braburne</hi> (when hee was a Jew in his diſ-affection of the dignity of the <hi>Lords day</hi>) plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for continuing the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> to <hi>Saturday,</hi> and againſt applying it unto the <hi>Lords day,</hi> by the phraſe of the
<note n="k" place="margin">M. <hi>Brab. def. p.</hi> 44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 164. <hi>&amp;</hi> 626.</note> Scriptures, by the

               </p>
               <p>Now the Objection is at the full (both for weight of exception, and the condition of perſons that except againſt the title <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to the <hi>Lords day</hi>)</p>
               <p>I will make a full, and (I hope) a ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I deſire it may be remembred, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the title <hi>Lords day,</hi> I have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to be given (by the holy Ghoſt) to the day of our Saviours reſurrection; and that others might do ſo, I have proved it alſo, though I dare not ſay, as

Revel.</hi> 1.10. and if hee can ſhew it mee but once more, he ſhall gratifie me much.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the negative exception againſt the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as the
<note n="q" place="margin">Biſh. <hi>White</hi> in his Treat. of the <hi>Sab.</hi> and <hi>Lords day. pag.</hi> 127.135.</note> Biſhop of Ely maketh it, where he ſaith, <hi>With the Apoſtles we call our weekly Holiday not</hi> Sabbath, <hi>but</hi> Lords day; <hi>the</hi> Lords day <hi>was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Sabbath <hi>by our Saviour, nor by any of his Apoſtles</hi> (ſaith
<note n="r" place="margin">Biſh. <hi>White. Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> he) and thence inferreth a conformity in our Chriſtian phraſe. If that be a good reaſon, wee muſt not call it <hi>Sunday:</hi> for, the Apoſtles called it no more <hi>Sunday,</hi> then they called it <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and the Primitive Fathers very ſeldome ſo termed it: and yet in our Churches Liturgie it is uſually called <hi>Sunday,</hi> and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or not at all <hi>Lords day,</hi> as before hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>

               <p>The ſumme of theſe obſervations concerning ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Aſſemblies twice a weeke, <hi>viz.</hi> upon Saturday the old <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>Lords day</hi> the new, (begun by the Apoſtles, for the quicker progreſſe of the Goſpel, and better advantage of devotion, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by Chriſtians in after ages, after their examples) is this;</p>
               <p>In the primitive times the <hi>Lords day</hi> was ſeldome called the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> becauſe then the old <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the Jewes was religiouſly obſerved with ſolemne Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; and while, and where two dayes were ſo ſolemnized (<hi>i. e. Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi>) it was ſit to call them (for diſtinction ſake, and to avoid confuſion)
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65743:105"/>by ſeverall names: and good reaſon that the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> having, for ſome thouſand of yeers, had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the title <hi>Sabbath,</hi> when yet the <hi>Lords day,</hi> or Chriſtian <hi>Sunday,</hi> had never ſhined in the world, ſhould be called the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> rather then any other day; and that the <hi>Lords day</hi> ſhould rather be called by another name, then by that.</p>
               <p>But now, at leaſt among us who uſe the day which was the Jewes holiday, not as a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or a day of <hi>reſt,</hi> but as a workeday; now, that ſome Jewiſhly, ſome prophanely affected, doe deny the name of <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> to the day wee celebrate, to ſupplant the ſupport of it by the fourth Commandement, (not as it is the <hi>Lords day,</hi> but as one of the ſeven) there is no danger of confuſion by calling the <hi>Lords day</hi> the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but due caution thereby given againſt ſuch conceits as tend to impeach the preheminence thereof.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOr is it any thing to prejudice the preheminence of the title <hi>Sabbath</hi> among us, that Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours (whether of Hiſtories or Dictionaries) take the word <hi>Sabbatum</hi> uſually for <hi>Saturday,</hi> (as

                     <hi>M. Brab.</hi> his <hi>defence, p.</hi> 44.</note> Maſter <hi>Braburn</hi> hath objected) ſince ſo long a cuſtome of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> obſervation upon Saturday, both in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh &amp; the Chriſtian Church, might eaſily prevail with many Writers, to take the terme as they found it in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65743:105"/>familiar uſe before their time, wherein they might be more facile, while they ſuſpected none advantage would be made of it againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>But if from that facility of phraſe exception be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the right of the Chriſtians weekely holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (though a day of <hi>reſt</hi>) to the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> a name of <hi>reſt,</hi> then we muſt have recourſe to the proper ſenſe of the word, and correſpondence of the thing, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake according to both, then to the improper and abuſive application of it, though cuſtomarie or uſuall.</p>
               <p>And as for the word <hi>Catholick,</hi> though many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> have familiarly called the <hi>Papiſts</hi> by that name; yet ſince they have inſolently gloryed in it, and perverſely inferred from our uſe of it (agreeing with their uſurpation) that wee that call them <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> doe (by conſequence) confeſſe that our ſelves are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who are oppoſite to them, as <hi>Coqueus</hi> concluded from King <hi>James</hi> his courteous <hi>charien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes,</hi> in the uſe of that title: it is requiſite that wee take it according to the right ſenſe and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it properly importeth, and ſo to deny them, and affirme our ſelves to be Catholicks; as the learned and judicious <hi>Chamier</hi> hath done, who in his controverſies continually calleth the Proteſtant tenets and arguments by the name of <hi>Catholick;</hi> and the contrary <hi>Popiſh,</hi> or the doctrine, arguments, or obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>So, ſince the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is impertinently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the wrong day, and wrongfully with-held from the right, with purpoſe to impeach the tenure of our Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath</hi> by the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65743:106"/>wee muſt not ſo much regard how it hath been rightly uſed in former times (while Saturday was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and obſerved for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or day of <hi>reſt</hi>) or how the tyranny of cuſtome hath carryed the name along (where there is no realty to anſwer it) as what it properly ſignifieth, and how that propriety of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification now belongeth rather to our day which we celebrate, with religious <hi>reſt,</hi> then to the Jewes day, which we hold not for an holiday, but for a workday, as the other dayes of the week allowed and imployed in ſecular labours; and wee muſt inure our tongues with correſpondent titles to make mention of them.</p>
               <p>And for the proper ſignification of the word, wee may appeale more pertinently and truely, then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Braburn</hi> could, to all Dictionaries in all languages, which render the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> (according to the

<note n="e" place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ironſide queſt.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>pag.</hi> 121.</note> Maſter <hi>Ironſide, ſhould not forſake the Roman Church, but where neceſsity doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force us; for then wee are guilty of the ſchiſme made in the Christian world:
<note n="f" place="margin">Ibid.</note> neither ſhould we vary from our ſelves ſo much as (were it poſsible) in a ſound or ſyllable, for then wee may juſtly bee noted of ſingularity and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: but both the Roman Churches, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, uſe to ſtile it the</hi> Lords day, <hi>not</hi> Sabbath day: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is made up of three particulars, whereof there is not one, but it is liable to reaſonable exception.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That there ſhould bee a ſtrict union betwixt the Church of Rome and the Reformed, and betwixt other reformed Churches among themſelves; except where neceſſity doth enforce a difference.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That to differ (except in ſuch a caſe)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65743:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>from the Romane Church, is to become guilty of Schiſme; and from the Reformed, is to bee guilty of ſingularity and affectation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that to ſtile the <hi>Lords day Sabbath,</hi> is to make our ſelves obnoxious to the charge of both. Whereto I anſwer:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that not to allow one Church to differ from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (but where neceſſity doth inforce) is to take away the Chriſtian liberty, which God hath granted to his Church, contrary to the 34. Article of ſubſcription, which runneth thus: <hi>It is not neceſſary, that traditions and ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly alike; for, at all times they have been diverſe, and may be changed (according to diverſity of countries, times, and manners) ſo that nothing be ordained againſt Gods Word: and a little afterward, every particular or nationall Church hath authority to ordaine, change, or aboliſh Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, ordained onely by mens authority.</hi> And accordingly we find them exerciſing their power in varieties of Rites and Ceremonies: for, the ancient

               <p>The Popiſh Church keeps the celebration of our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65743:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>Lords Nativity, and other Holidaies (according to the Gregorian Calendar) ten daies ſooner then the Reformed, eſpecially in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And in many other points they differ beſides theſe, which are not of neceſſity, as (if neceſſity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) might bee abundantly manifeſted out of <hi>William Durandus</hi> his <hi>Rationale,</hi> and <hi>John Steph. Durantus</hi> his three bookes <hi>de Ritibus Eccleſ Cathol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reformed Churches differ among themſelves in many particulars. For inſtance, we in <hi>England</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve more Holidaies then the <hi>Tranſmarine</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, more then his Majeſty that laſt was required to be kept of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Articles ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at <hi>Perth, an.</hi> 1618. our Church of <hi>England</hi> hath a Canon for the Croſſe after Baptiſme, and bowing at the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> many Reformed Churches have none for either of them: and in <hi>England,</hi> Cathedrall Churches differ from moſt others, in the uſe of Copes, Organs, prick-ſong tunes, and many other waies beſides. Of theſe, with the reſt of the differences, we may ſay they are ſuch, as no neceſſity doth inforce; yet will not Maſter <hi>Ironſide</hi> (I ſuppoſe) be forward to charge the later Church in departing from the former; nor the Reformed, in diſſenting from the Romiſh; nor the Engliſh, in differing from the Scottiſh Church; nor Cathedralls, in varying from other Churches (for ſuch particulars) with ſchiſme, ſingularity, or affectation: Which I doe not mention with any mind to maintain any thing that is amiſſe in the different manner of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedralls from other Churches; (for, I wiſh rather a reformation, then a ratification of them as now they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65743:108"/>are) but to give fit inſtance againſt Maſter <hi>Ironſide</hi> his poſition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, and ſhall (where it is requiſite) prove it, that neither the Romiſh, nor many of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches out of <hi>England,</hi> are ſo Orthodox in the Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in particular, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the fourth Commandement, as they ſhould be, and as the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are; and it is no marvell, if their dialect be like unto their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is too late to impute ſchiſme, ſingularity, or affectation to the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> when the uſe of it is juſtified by ſuch both reaſons and authorities, as have been produced; and when not onely perſons of chiefe preheminence ſo call it, but that it is as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into uſe by moſt, as approved by the beſt, as hath been obſerved.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for the Reformed Churches, the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who firſt ſeparated themſelves from the Church of Rome (as the Whore of Babylon) called the <hi>Lords day Sabbath,</hi> and that ſo familiarly, that nothing was more uſuall among them, as a learned
<note n="h" place="margin">Doct. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> in a MS. of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </note> Doctor hath obſerved of them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, wee muſt not accompt it ſchiſme, ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and affectation, to conforme rather to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren about us, then to either brethren or adverſaries that are ſeparated from us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, nor are wee more liable to exception of ſchiſme, ſingularity, or affectation, by uſing the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> for <hi>Lords day,</hi> then by putting <hi>Sunday</hi> for it (the moſt uſuall name in our Service Booke) which is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65743:108"/>as unwonted a word in the reformed Churches as the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> is, and hath been

                  </note> another book of his, (which is yet a MS.) wherein ſaith hee, <hi>the laſt Parliament may well bee thought to diſlike the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>as to the</hi> Lords day; <hi>for neither in the title of the Act which is for the keeping of the</hi> Lords day, <hi>nor yet throughout the body thereof is this name uſed, though the heatheniſh name</hi> Sunday <hi>be in both; yea, and though the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement read in the Church, ſpeaketh of ſanctifying of the</hi> Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Hee might have alledged two Acts of two Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the one, <hi>anno</hi> 1. of King <hi>Charles, chap.</hi> 1. The other <hi>anno</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. In the former whereof there is the name of <hi>Sunday</hi> in the title of the Act, though not in the body of it (as in the Statute, <hi>anno</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 133. of the Stat. at large) and the name <hi>Lords day</hi> once in the title, and thrice in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65743:109"/>the body of the Act: and in the later Act, they are each of them named once in the title, and once in the body of the Act, but the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> not at all.</p>
               <p>Whereto I anſwer, firſt for the Proceſſe; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which I ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſuch a Proceſſe might be taken up when there were many Jewes, and much Judaiſme in the Land, as in the reignes of many of our Popiſh Kings; which gave occaſion of warrant in contracts and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines againſt Jewes by eſpeciall mention, who kept a foot the name and obſervation of the old <hi>Sabbath:</hi> and ſo it might bee then (as in the dayes of ancient Fathers) a word of diſtinction betwixt the Jewiſh and Chriſtians holiday. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, If not for that reaſon; yet the uſe of the name in that ſenſe (having obtained ſuch generall paſſage in the times precedent) might bee a motive to the Lawyers to continue it, though the reaſon which began it deſcended not ſo low as to their age: as wee call an houre-glaſſe in Greek and Latin, <hi>Clep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydra,</hi> which ſignifieth the ſtealing away of water drop by drop, from one bottle to another, (for at firſt it was made to meaſure time by water, though now it bee made to run with ſand only.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their Proceſſe being Latine, haply they made choice rather of that word which had in it ſome reliſh of Religion, both among Jewes and ancient Chriſtians (and ſo hath the word <hi>Sabbath</hi>), then of that which was (for that language) in a manner meerly heatheniſh, to wit, <hi>Saturday;</hi> and though the word <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> (which is originally heatheniſh as wel as <hi>Saturday</hi>) be uſed in our Church <hi>Liturgie,</hi> yet we call the <hi>Lords
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65743:109"/>day Sunday,</hi> not from the Sunne in the Firmament, but from the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſſe, Mal.</hi> 4.2. as hath been formerly obſerved: the word <hi>Saturday</hi> is not capable of a ſignification ſo ſacred and ſutable to the perſon of our Saviour, the <hi>Lord of the</hi> Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though the Lawyers did in their Latin writs uſe the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> for <hi>Saturday,</hi> yet they did neither forbid nor forbeare to uſe it of the <hi>Lords day</hi> in French and in Engliſh; as in <hi>Fitzherberts natura Brevium</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Pleas cannot be held upon Quindena Paſchae

               <p>Now to anſwer to the objection taken from the Acts of Parliament, I ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That in the
<note n="k" place="margin">M. <hi>Pultons</hi> Abridgement, <hi>fol.</hi> 134. <hi>p. b.</hi>
                  </note> Parliament of the 19. of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth, cap.</hi> 13. which is of <hi>Hats</hi> and <hi>Caps,</hi> the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is uſed for the <hi>Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Act fore-cited, concerning the obſervation of the day wee Chriſtians keepe, giving it the <hi>name of</hi> Lords day, <hi>or</hi> Sunday, <hi>not of</hi> Sabbath; I anſwer, That I have heard a
<note n="″" place="margin">M. <hi>Ed. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> late Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Cheſter.</note> Parliament man (of eminent note in his time) ſay, that the bill was penned and paſſed in the Commons Houſe in the name of the <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> and I have read, that (when an Act was made for reformation of abuſe by profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65743:110"/>of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>)
<note n="l" place="margin">In a MS. of Doct. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> concerning the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </note> Doct. <hi>Lake Biſhop of Bath and Wells, was ſomewhat eager to have it called by the name of Sabbath:</hi> and it had not been the worſe, if that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father had been allowed as a Godfather, to give the name and title in the Statute.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though ſome prime perſons of the upper Houſe thought it fit (in the Act) to make uſe rather of the word <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Lords day,</hi> then of the word <hi>Sabbath;</hi> it doth not follow, they diſallowed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the uſe of that word: for, they were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his Majeſties Proclamation and Briefes (calling our weekly Holiday by the name <hi>Sabbath</hi>) nor how the name and day were incorporated into our Communion Booke, with a prayer at the end of the fourth Commandement, for pardon of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation paſt, and for grace to ſhun the like in time to come; nor that that Commandement, as well as the reſt, was a part of the common Catechiſme, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the inſtruction of children before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they might haply mention the day wee obſerve for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by the name of <hi>Sunday,</hi> becauſe that name was uſed in the Statute of the 5. and 6.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stat.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 133</note> of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, wherein it was enacted, that all <hi>Sundaies</hi> in the yeare ſhould be kept holy, and by the name <hi>Lords day,</hi> becauſe that is the name which S. <hi>John</hi> giveth it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. and which the Latine Church moſt uſed, to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Saturday Sabbath;</hi> and for the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> they might at that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe theſe two names (choſen for theſe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65743:111"/>reaſons) were ſufficient to make it well enough known unto all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Booke was like to bee upheld with ſo much honour and reputation (ſo long as the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is a part of the Liturgy and Catechiſme, and both of them are in force and uſe) that there was no ſuch need to grace it with a particular mention in the Act, as the other two titles; yet if all three had been brought to a ſerious conſultation for the choice and uſe of one above the reſt, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> of right might have had the preheminence; and ſo much I hope to manifeſt in the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>A compariſon of the names</hi> Sabbath, Lords day, <hi>and</hi> Sunday, <hi>with a reſolution of the Queſtion for the name</hi> Sabbath, <hi>as the beſt, and fitteſt to be the moſt uſuall title of our weekly Holiday.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough all the three names be lawfull enough, and may each of them (as juſt occaſion requireth) bee uſed, without either ſinne or ſcandall (if there be not more fault in the mind of the ſpeaker, or hearer, then in the words themſelves) yet ſince they are not all at ſuch an equipoize for ſenſe or acceptation, but that there may be obſerved a preheminence among them, which may incline the cuſtome of ſpeech to one more then to another, thereafter as it is apprehended, when the name is uttered or heard: It will bee a matter of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65743:111"/>ſome uſe, to obſerve the importance and prelation of theſe names, ſo farre as to reſolve, which of them in our Church and age is moſt ſit to become moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among us.</p>
               <p>Names are of chiefe accompt for theſe ſeven parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, for <hi>Antiquity:</hi> ſecondly, for <hi>Authority:</hi> third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for <hi>Significancy:</hi> fourthly, for <hi>Facility to the ſpeaker:</hi> fifthly, for <hi>Acceptability with the hearer:</hi> ſixthly, for <hi>Frequency:</hi> ſeventhly, for <hi>Efficacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, if we compare them for <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the name <hi>Sunday</hi> (in the language of the world) is more ancient then <hi>Lords day,</hi> the name <hi>Lords day</hi> (in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Church) a more ancient name then <hi>Sunday:</hi> for, we find the <hi>Lords day</hi> in <hi>Revelat.</hi> 1.10. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 94. yeare after Chriſt; but the firſt mention of <hi>Sunday</hi> (as a Chriſtian Holiday) is in <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Apol. ad Antoninum pium,</hi> about the yeare 150. but the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for a weekly Holiday, is ancienter then them both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we compare them for <hi>Authority,</hi> we may conſider it in a double ſenſe, as divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by divine Authority the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Lords day</hi> have the beſt warrant; for, they are both Scripture names, and the name <hi>Sunday</hi> is not ſo.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, in the tranſlation of the Bible, publiſhed in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his daies, <hi>anno</hi> 1540. before which Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> prefixed a Preface, the words of Saint <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 1.10. are rendred thus: <hi>I was in the ſpret on a Sunday</hi> (as I noted before) but in the originall there is not that word which ſignifieth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65743:112"/>either <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Son:</hi> and in all other tranſlations that I have ſeen, it is rendred (according to the originall) <hi>Lords day,</hi> and not <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> for a weekly Holiday, is in the fourth Commandement of the Decalogue (the greateſt warrant of Authority that can be) thrice mentioned: neither the name <hi>Lords day</hi> nor <hi>Sunday</hi> are ſo. And for humane Authority in the Liturgy of our Church, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> are both mentioned, and the name <hi>Lords day</hi> (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) not at all. In the Canons of the Church, though the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (for the Engliſh edition, as I have already obſerved) be not omitted, the names <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Lords day</hi> are more often mentioned; and in the Latine Canons, the title <hi>Lords day</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we compare them for <hi>ſignificancy,</hi> that ſwayeth the preheminence by three reſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt, by <hi>Dignity:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Propriety:</hi> thirdly, <hi>Perſpicuity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for <hi>Dignity,</hi> the name <hi>Lords day</hi> hath prelation over the other two, and carrieth a ſignification of his dignity, who is <hi>Lord</hi> of all, both Angels, Men, and Divels; and imports with his perſon, his abſolute Lordſhip over the world, eſpecially over his Church, and the name <hi>Sunday</hi> ſheweth his illuſtrious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, if wee underſtand the terme, according to the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> for the <hi>Sunne of Righteouſneſſe;</hi> but the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (in its Grammaticall ſenſe) ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely Reſt, which is in dignity inferiour to them both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for <hi>Propriety,</hi> that is to be conſidered as oppoſed, either to <hi>figurativeneſſe,</hi> or to <hi>community,</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:65743:112"/>taking <hi>proper</hi> for that which is not <hi>figurative,</hi> the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſignifying in the Grammaticall ſenſe, a <hi>[literall reſt]</hi> which is required on an holiday, is a more proper word then either of the other, which are not well underſtood without a figure; for wee call the <hi>Sabbath Lords day</hi> by an
<note n="a" place="margin">For all dayes are the Lords, but this by an eſpeciall eminency.</note> 
                  <hi>Antinomaſie,</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> by a
<note n="b" place="margin">In the ſenſe of the Heathens, who dedicated the day to the Sun, and thence gave it that name.</note> 
                  <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie,</hi> or
<note n="c" place="margin">In the religious ſenſe in the Prophet <hi>Malach. c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Metaphor:</hi> But taking <hi>propriety</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>generality</hi> or <hi>community,</hi> the names <hi>Lords day</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> (as in application to dayes) are more proper and particular, noting a ſet and certaine day in the weeke, <hi>viz.</hi> that which wee Chriſtians celebrate, and none other, as the
<note n="d" place="margin">Soveraigne Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary errors. <hi>pag.</hi> 7.</note> Authour of the <hi>ſoveraigne Antidote</hi> well obſerveth: Whereas <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> hath been a name for any holiday which may fall out any day of the weeke. In which reſpect, if there had not been other conſiderable reaſons to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hee had well reſolved, <hi>that when wee ſpeake of a time of reſt undeterminately, and in generall, the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>is the fitteſt; the other two,</hi> Lords day <hi>and</hi> Sunday, <hi>when we ſpeake determinately of that day which is obſerved in the Chriſtian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, For <hi>Perſpicuitie,</hi> that is moſt perſpicuous which is leaſt ambiguous; ſo is the name <hi>Sunday,</hi> which preſently points all to the day wee obſerve: but the names <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Lords day</hi> are not at all times, and in all places ſo cleare, ſince the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> hath beene for a long time taken for <hi>Saturday,</hi> and the name <hi>Lords day</hi> hath beene taken, not onely for the weekly <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> but alſo for the day of Chriſts <hi>Nativity, Paſsion, Aſcenſion,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:65743:113"/>and laſt <hi>Judgement,</hi> as hath beene ſhewed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter. Beſides, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there bee Lords many,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. and the more they bee, the more ambiguous is the name whereof that word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up the one halfe.</p>
               <p>Yet, to ſay the truth, in our Church and age, they are all perſpicuous and cleere enough; ſo that there is ſcarce any one ſo ſilly, but hee preſently knoweth, if hee heare the name <hi>Sabbath, Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Sunday,</hi> what day of the week is underſtood by them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If wee compare them for <hi>facilitie</hi> or readineſſe of ſpeech, the names <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> or <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> are more apt to be taken up; as when wee ſpeake of the weekly holiday paſt, or to come, it is readier to ſay, (and withall, more diſtinctly underſtood) the laſt <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or the laſt <hi>Sunday;</hi> next <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or next <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> ſome <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or ſome <hi>Sunday,</hi> as in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Briefes fore-noted, then the laſt <hi>Lords day,</hi> or the next <hi>Lords day,</hi> or ſome <hi>Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, If for <hi>acceptation</hi> with ſpeaker or hearer, they are every one of them ſingle (for the moſt part) of better reliſh then the other two with ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome like beſt of the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſome of the name <hi>Lords day,</hi> ſome of <hi>Sunday;</hi> and by that wee have obſerved of each of them before, it appeareth that there are many of the better ſort of men, who ſtand divided in their inclinations and prelations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of the titles fore-mentioned: and yet, when two holidaies were obſerved in a week, the name <hi>Lords day</hi> (for the day wee celebrate) was moſt acceptable to moſt men: and (ſince they have all of them beene taken to indifferent uſe by the wiſer
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65743:113"/>ſort) it hath been leſſe obvious to exception then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Sunday</hi> have beene, while ſome (though without juſt cauſe) have charged the one with Judaiſme, the other with Paganiſme, which is worſe, ſince our Religion hath more affinity with Jewiſh, then with Heatheniſh principles.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, For <hi>frequencie</hi> or community of uſe; all in our Church are bound to aſſent unto the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and to uſe it alſo by the obligation that tyeth them to the Liturgy and Catechiſme of the Church; and as Religion hath advanced, ſo hath that name prevailed, and bin moſt frequently uſed by the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of our Church: untill that (a very few yeers agoe) ſome tooke up ſuch exceptions againſt it as have beene ſeene in the precedent Diſcourſe, which either reaſon may work out, or time wear out of mens opinions; as in the title <hi>Lords day</hi> hath come to paſſe; for that, at at the firſt, did not paſſe without cavill and contempt: for, in the memory of ſome yet alive, many were as much offended (ſuſpecting a tang of exceſſive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe) that ſome ſaid <hi>Lords day</hi> for <hi>Sunday,</hi> as any now are at thoſe who ſay rather <hi>Sabbath</hi> then either.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, If wee compare the three names for <hi>efficacie</hi> to edification, (which ought to bee of moſt accompt with us) we may ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Lords day,</hi> at firſt apprehenſion are more ready and effectuall to minde us of, and diſpoſe us to pious conceits, then the name <hi>Sunday</hi> is, which at firſt blench (according to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe and primitive uſe) hath an idolatrous inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; for it was ſo called, with reference to, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65743:114"/>reverence of the Planet <hi>Sol,</hi> which was made an Idol by the Saxons, our predeceſſors in this Kingdome; though the word be capable of a better ſenſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene ſhewed upon <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.2. and hath beene a good while ſince purged from the ſmack and ſuſpicion of idolatry or ſuperſtition, wherewith it hath been tainted in former times.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That though the title <hi>Lords day</hi> deſigne ſome day of eminent note, and by conſent of moſt be taken for the day on which Chriſt roſe from the dead; and though it may alſo import (with a little working of the underſtanding upon it) that he is Lord both of times and perſons, with other religious docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which conduce much to the edification of the Church, yet the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> edifieth much more, as to the ſolemne ſervices of religion, which ought to prevail in this compariſon; for it ſignifieth <hi>reſt,</hi> or ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſecular labours (without which no day can be holily and ſolemnly obſerved) and that, by an eaſie tranſition from the letter to a figure, may admoniſh us of our Saviours reſting in the grave all the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which hee punctually obſerved while it was in force; and of his reſting from all further paine, or ſuffering for our Redemption, upon his Reſurrection; and of Gods reſting ſatisfied with us, hee having then fully diſcharged all our debt, and quit himſelfe from priſon, as by a moſt compleat ſatisfaction to his Fathers Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and laſt of all, of that everlaſting <hi>rest, Hebr.</hi> 4.9. which in the literall <hi>Sabbath</hi> was partly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> guides us to the fourth Commandement of the Decalogue, where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65743:114"/>of time, for the weekly recourſe of it is to be read, and the perſonall extent of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuperiours and inferiours home-borne or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, together with the duties of the day, both affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and negative, and the reaſons both of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obſervation of them, and thoſe both many and weighty, and ſo it upholdeth our ſolemne and ſacred Aſſemblies once a weeke, then which nothing is of more moment to ediſication.</p>
               <p>And all this it doth in ſuch ſort, that no cavills of men can either weaken, or darken its tenure from that text, in the judgement of any reaſonable man; nor can any one (who conſidereth that) hold himſelfe ſo little obliged to an holy celebration of one day in the weeke, as if no more ſhould be pleaded for it then what is either formally or vertually contained in the title <hi>Lords day,</hi> or in any part of holy Scripture, beſides the fourth Commandement, whereto it directeth us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> keepeth title to that ground, which (while it is made good for the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one day in ſeven, and not for <hi>Saturday Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> in particular, as it eaſily may) is the beſt meanes to maintaine the Authority of our weekly Holiday, againſt any Adverſary whatſoever.</p>
               <p>To wind up thoſe compariſons to a concluſion, though every one of the words may lawfully be uſed (as before hath been ſaid) I conceive (and hope in the vertue of the premiſſes I may reſolve) that for our Church and time the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is fitteſt to bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly uſed for the day wee keep holy every weeke; ſince for Antiquity, Authority, Propriety, Significan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Facility, Frequency of uſe among the religious of

               <p>To which wee may adde (and it is a conſideration of ſome moment) that thoſe that have moſt ill will to our Chriſtian Holiday (as
<note n="b" place="margin">Maſt. <hi>Brab.</hi> in his defence. <hi>pag.</hi> 54.</note> Maſter <hi>Braburne</hi> had) would rob it of its right to the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and therewith of its right for this authenticke Tenure by the fourth Commandement: which it cannot claime under the name <hi>Sunday,</hi> nor will it bee allowed under the name <hi>Lords day;</hi> for, <hi>I marvell with what face</hi> (ſaith

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Againſt this prelation of the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> it may bee ſaid by way of exception, that the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is leſſe proper then the name <hi>Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Sunday:</hi> for it is a name for any day of Reſt, as hath been obſerved and acknowledged (on all hands.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65743:115"/>to more dayes then the weekly Holiday, whereof we treat, if there bee a ceſſation from labour upon them; and ſo it was in the Old Teſtament: for, the Jewes had many Holidayes which were named ſometimes <hi>Sabbaths;</hi> and yet the weekly <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by an excellency, had that denomination belonging unto it, which other Holidayes had not.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Papiſt</hi> object this, I will give for inſtance the word <hi>Pope,</hi> which anciently was a generall title for all Biſhops, as I have
<note n="d" place="margin">In my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clature.</note> obſerved and proved at large in another worke: but now uſe hath confined it to the Biſhop of Rome. If a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> the word <hi>Bible</hi> may ſerve to anſwer him, which (as the learned know) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth in the Greeke tongue a booke in generall, and hath been in uſe with that latitude of extent; yet by an <hi>Antinomaſie,</hi> or excellency (and we may ſay the ſame of the word <hi>Scripture</hi>) it is now taken onely for the booke of the holy Scripture, and it is (though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon word of old) now become ſo proper, as that we know what one meaneth, when hee ſaith a Bible, as well as if hee ſaid Gods Booke; ſo wee may know (as moſt men uſe the word <hi>Sabbath</hi>) as well what day is meant by it, as if we ſaid the <hi>Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>Lords day</hi> is (in its Grammaticall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) of as large extent as the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there be</hi> Lords <hi>many,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. as wee noted even now: and for that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all dayes dedicated to publicke devotion, whereby God, our great Lord, is honoured; yea, and all weeke dayes (as hee is Lord of all time however meaſured or entitled) might bee called <hi>Lords daies:</hi> and onely uſe hath ſhrunke in generality into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65743:116"/>and confined the title <hi>Lords day</hi> to that which hath a weekly recourſe for religious obſervation (as it hath done the name <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Bible</hi> but now mentioned) and in this alſo the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> hath as much propriety as it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> To ſuccour this objection,
<note n="c" place="margin">M. <hi>Ironſide. qu.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 122.</note> Maſter <hi>Ironſide</hi> his Argument may be brought in, which is this, <hi>That name which doth leſſe edifie is leſſe proper, this I thinke</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>will be eaſily agreed on by all parties: But the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>doth leſſe edifie; for, it leads us onely to a ceſſation from bodily labour: on the contrary, the</hi> Lords day <hi>doth betoken and explaine the whole nature and duty of the day; as the remembrance of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, acknowledging his Lordſhip over the Church, and over all other creatures in the world: Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Both <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> are infirme and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to beget, or bring forth the concluſion which hee deſireth: Firſt, for the <hi>major, That name which doth leſſe edifie is leſſe proper</hi> (ſaith he, and hee ſaith it with confidence, that all parties will yeeld conſent to that conceipt:) But if his propoſition bee generall (and ſo it muſt be, or it will be too narrow for a Logicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion) I conceive it is ſubject to juſt exception, and ſo is not like to obtaine an acceptation of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as he talketh of: for, it imports a neerer affinity betwixt propriety of words and edification, then wee find in uſe, and ſets words not proper at a further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from edification then there is cauſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the firſt; <hi>Proper</hi> words doe not alwaies beſt edifie, nor <hi>improper</hi> or <hi>figurative</hi> leaſt: nay, many times, <hi>improper</hi> words and <hi>figurative</hi> ſpeeches give
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65743:116"/>both moſt light to the underſtanding, and worke with greateſt force upon the affections, and ſo are of beſt uſe for edification: There are memorable inſtances hereof both in the Scripture, and in other Authours, which will be ſuperfluous in this place; ſince we need none other then his owne word [<hi>edifie</hi>] which (as hee uſeth it) is a <hi>figurative,</hi> and not a <hi>proper</hi> terme: for, it ſignifieth <hi>properly</hi> the building of an houſe, <hi>figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the bringing of light to the underſtanding, working heat upon the affection, or any furtherance in matter of Religion; and in that ſenſe it is uſually both uttered and underſtood by men, whether learned or illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if propriety and edification conſort ſo well together (as hee ſaith) it maketh much for the preheminence we plead for; for, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is proper.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as not <hi>figurative,</hi> ſignifying a literall Reſt, which is requiſite for celebration of our weekly Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and proper.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as not common to all Holidaies; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe now having confined it to our weekly Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, though called alſo <hi>Sunday,</hi> or <hi>Lords day,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different impreſſions ſet upon the fancy or affection of thoſe that mention it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the <hi>minor,</hi> which is, <hi>But the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>doth leſſe edifie then the</hi> Lords day <hi>doth: for, it leads us onely to an outward ceſſation:</hi> I anſwer;</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> doth lead us directly to the fourth Commandement, the fundamentall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for a weekly Holiday; and if the foundation be of moſt uſe in building and edification, the name
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65743:117"/>
                  <hi>Sabbath,</hi> leading us to that, doth beſt edifie; the word <hi>Lords day</hi> leads us to a tenure of leſſe both evidence and aſſurance, and conſequently of leſſe authority, as hath partly been ſhewed already, and we ſhall further manifeſt afterwards.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The name <hi>Sabbath</hi> leadeth not onely to a ceſſation from bodily labour, but to holineſſe alſo; for it leadeth us to the Commandement, which ſaith as well, <hi>Remember the</hi> Sabbath day <hi>to keep it holy;</hi> as, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no manner of work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas hee ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Lords day <hi>doth beſt open and explaine the nature and duty of the day, as the remembrance of Chriſts Reſurrection, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his Lordſhip over the Church, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures of the world.</hi> Let any one reade the fourth Commandement, where the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is named, and the firſt of the <hi>Revelat. ver.</hi> 10. where the <hi>Lords day</hi> is named, and let him tell mee which of them doth more explaine the duty of the day: nay, the name <hi>Lords day</hi> doth neither expreſſely, nor by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence direct to the duties of the day, nor to the Evangelicall ground of it, <hi>the Reſurrection of our Saviour;</hi> ſince other dayes have been ſet up with our weekly holiday (by way of competition for that title) as hath before beene obſerved.</p>
               <p>Beſides, When the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> leadeth to the fourth Commandement, it bringeth us to the title <hi>Lords day;</hi> for if it be the <hi>Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> as it is there called, it is the <hi>Lords day;</hi> for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is a day, and hee is called <hi>Lord of the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.28. and the Lordſhip hee hath there is not onely particular, over the Church; but univerſall,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65743:117"/>over the world: for there it is ſaid, that <hi>in ſixe dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and ſea, and every thing contained in them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I deny not, but the title <hi>Lords day</hi> is generally uſed for the day of our Saviours Reſurrection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as a Lord of life and death, he raiſed his body from the ſtate of the dead, and returned to the living, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing thereby, <hi>actually</hi> his owne reſtitution to a glorious liberty, and <hi>vertually</hi> ours: but that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is more remote from the ſanctification of one day in ſeven, then that which the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> doth import.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, I deny not but that it might bee well uſed to edification, if men would ſo take it to bee the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as to take none of it from the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory, to the promotion of their owne profit, or practice of their owne pleaſures; wherein moſt make as bold with it, to ſerve their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>lar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or ſenſuall humours (ſometimes upon very ſleight occaſions) as if not Chriſt, but they were Lords of that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the name <hi>Lords day</hi> inclineth to no erroneous conceipts, and the name <hi>Sunday,</hi> though once it did, doth not in our dayes bring with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perill of Paganiſme: but the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> may import ſome danger of Judaiſme; therefore the name <hi>Lords day</hi> is the beſt, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> the worſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have in effect, though not formally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to this objection before, and have made it plaine, that Judaiſme is beſt oppoſed, and thoſe that are Jewiſh moſt diſpleaſed by entitling our <hi>Lords day</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:65743:118"/>to the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and to the authority of the fourth Commandement, as it preſcribeth the holy obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one day in ſeven, and by averring, that their ſeventh day in <hi>order</hi> is not expreſſely there preſcribed, but a ſeventh day in <hi>number,</hi> as ſhall be manifeſted in its proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But a learned and zealous Pleader for a weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the <hi>Lords day</hi> a reall preeminence above the old <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſaying,
<note n="f" place="margin">M. <hi>J. Walker</hi> in his book of the Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath. p.</hi> 89.90.</note> 
                  <hi>that the old</hi> Sabbath <hi>had no other light nor life in it, but onely from obſcure promiſes, and dark ſhadowes, through which Chriſt was ſeen as things afarre off are ſeene, and in the ſtarre-light nights: but the</hi> Lords day <hi>(the firſt day of the weeke) hath light and life from the</hi> Sunne of Righteouſneſſe, <hi>who in it roſe up to bee the light of life to all Nations.</hi> And after that hee giveth it a nominall preheminence under the title <hi>Lords day;
<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 90, 91.</note> God,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>hath given it a most honourable name and title above all the daies of the weeke: for the holy Evangeliſt, and divine Apoſtle Saint</hi> John, <hi>who was the intimate, beloved, and boſome Diſciple of the Lord, and did best know his minde, calls it the</hi> Lords day, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. <hi>and the word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Lord, <hi>is the ſame in ſignification with Gods proper Name</hi> Jehovah, <hi>and moſt commonly is uſed (in the new Teſtament) to expreſſe that ſacred Name.</hi> And if that day and name both be more excellent then that of the old Teſtament, the denomination ſhould be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it; and ſo we ſhould call it rather <hi>Lords day</hi> then <hi>Sabbath.</hi> To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That howſoever the new <hi>Sabbath</hi> bee (in many reſpects) more excellent then the old; yet the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65743:118"/>name <hi>Sabbath</hi> may be very agreeable to them both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that if name <hi>Lords day</hi> be a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent name then the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> it doth not follow it ſhould be more uſuall &amp; ordinary: for, there be many other intimatious of moment, for the uſe of a name (as before we have noted) and for inſtance, though the name <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> bee a more excellent name then <hi>Sonne of man;</hi> yet our Saviour, who beſt knew how to ſpeake (<hi>for he ſpake as no man ever did, John</hi> 7.46.) called himſelfe oftner <hi>Son of man,</hi> then <hi>Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> doth import more clearly and aſſuredly a weekly Holiday (as wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it) then the name <hi>Lords day</hi> doth: for that is queſtionable (as before wee have ſhewed) whether it be to be taken for the day of our Saviours Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or no; and if that be reſolved on, then whether it note that individuall day onely, on which he aroſe, or other daies alſo that ſucceed it: and if others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely an Anniverſary day, as Eaſter; or a weekly day, as the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is, and hath been ſince it was firſt ordained: but the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> without all queſtion, ſignifieth a day of Reſt among ſixe daies of labour, and ſo one ſet day within the circle of the weeke.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> being the title of the fourth Commandement (which is the beſt warrant for a weekly Holiday, and which preſcribeth our duty, both for what we muſt forbeare, and what performe, and preſſeth it by many effectuall reaſons) there is great reaſon, that it ſhould bee more uſed then any other; which in ſuch materiall conſiderations is not comparable to it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> guiding us to the fourth
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65743:119"/>Commandement, will bring us readily to the title <hi>Lords day</hi> (as before hath been obſerved) but the name <hi>Lords day</hi> in that text, where it is noted, <hi>viz. Revel.</hi> 1.10. (the chiefe, if not the onely text for that title in the New Teſtament) giveth none intimation of a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> neither in Deed, nor in Name; therefore the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as more ſignificant and monitory, is fitter for inſtruction and uſe, then the name <hi>Lords day</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, for ſuch reaſons as theſe, or ſome other of like importance, the fore-cited Authour uſeth the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> more frequently (throughout his whole booke) then any other whatſoever; and ſetteth it as the title, in the higheſt place of every page, though no man expreſſe a dearer affection to the dignity of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> then he doth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he ſo far approves of the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for our weekly Holiday, that he ſetteth upon them, who ſay, the <hi>Lords day</hi> was not called <hi>Sabbath</hi> (in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, next to the Apoſtles, nor ſince by any, but onely Jewiſh <hi>Sabbatharians</hi>) with ſome ſharp termes, calling them
<note n="h" place="margin">M. <hi>Walker</hi> in his Doctrine of the <hi>Sabb. ch.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 113. but <hi>pag.</hi> 112 of the impreſſion at London. 1641.</note> 
                  <hi>Adverſaries of a bold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent face,</hi> who make that objection. Thus farre the exceptions againſt the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> both ſimple and comparative with other titles.</p>
               <p>Though I have ſet my wits on worke, on the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabbatarian ſide, both to multiply &amp; fortifie objections againſt that name, as applyed to the day of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian devotion, I can find nothing more, which is of any weight or worth to bee objected or anſwered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the compariſon of the names of <hi>Sabbath, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and <hi>Lords day,</hi> and the reſolution for the name
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65743:119"/>
                  <hi>Sabbath:</hi> of which we may now (I hope) without all appearance of partiality or preſumption, conclude, <hi>That the name</hi> Sabbath <hi>is of beſt uſe to ſupport the true Doctrine of our Chriſtian Holiday, both for the time and tenure of it; for diſcovery of duties required on it, and for incitement to the conſcionable practice of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:</hi> and therefore (notwithſtanding the contrary determination of

               <p>Thirdly, In clearing the doubts that are made of thoſe names and titles of our Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath;</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſonages of higheſt place, with many more of the better ſort (though of inferiour rank in the Church or Common-weale) are cleared from ſuch reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imputations, as (by taunting at, or traducing of the lawfull uſe of thoſe names, eſpecially that of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>) ſome, with Iſmaelitiſh malignity, expreſſely, or by conſequence, have caſt upon them; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the fore noted judicious Divine hath ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in his <hi>Antidote againſt Sabbatary errours,</hi> though (me thinks) a little too faintly; viz.
<note n="c" place="margin">A ſoveraign Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary errors. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſober and moderate, ought not to bee cenſured with too much ſeverity,</hi> (not with any ſeverity at all, hee might have ſaid) <hi>nor charged with Judaiſme, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they call</hi> Sunday <hi>by the name of</hi> Sabbath; (if hee had ſaid, if commonly they call <hi>Sunday</hi> by the name of <hi>Sabbath,</hi> hee had ſpoken no more then the truth will beare)
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>for there is none of the three names,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>to bee condemned as unlawfull, but every one is to bee left to his Chriſtian liberty herein, ſo long as ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Authority reſtraineth it not, and ſo that hee doe it without vanity or affectation in himſelfe, and without judging or deſpiſing of his brother that doth otherwiſe:</hi> which is a pious and prudent proviſo, though ſo farre defective as it importeth a meere paritie, without any preheminence on the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> behalfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By explication of theſe titles (in this ſort) wee may anſwer many paſſages of the ancient Fathers, produced againſt our weekly holiday in the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65743:121"/>name of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> whereby they meane not (as many miſconceive them, and ſo miſapply them) any prejudice to the holy obſervation of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as in weekely recourſe in the Chriſtian Church, but preciſely and punctually the Saturday <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which we hold as much as they to be aboliſhed, and much more then ſome of them did.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If all the names bee lawfull, and that of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> moſt uſefull (as hath beene ſhewed) let us bee ſure to make uſe of it upon all faire and fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, (though wee neither wholly forbeare the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two titles, nor quarrell with any for their more familiar uſe of them) that wee may uphold the tenure of the day; together with the title of it by the fourth Commandement, whereto I deſire to exhort the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the more earneſt intreaty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſome (with ſuch ſupercilious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine) have indeavoured to diſgrace that title that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as much too modeſt, as they too bold) have beene affraid, or aſhamed to uſe it; and I remember one, who was of eminent parts and place, and who formerly had divers times uſed it in a printed booke, having upon occaſion named the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> preſently recalled the word, as if it had beene a fault, and tooke up the title <hi>Sunday</hi> in ſtead thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe if wee let goe the name of the time, wee may bee like to loſe the thing in time to come, or, at leaſt, to looſen and weaken its claime to the beſt authority on which it depends; for as it is a weekly holiday, wee cannot plead better for it, then by the proportion of the fourth Commandement, and that being made good upon that ground, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65743:121"/>about the particular day (within the circle of ſeven) will bee the more eaſily compoſed, ſince it is no more then other proofe and evidence (inferiour to an expreſſe precept of the Decalogue) may well ſupport.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I would now put a ſinall period to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative diſcourſe, but that opportunity prompts mee, and it may bee a twofold duty (which I owe both to my ſuperiours, and to this ſacred cauſe, wherein they are intereſſed as ſupreme Judges over it, and I as a faithfull Advocate for it) bindes mee to bend my concluſion towards the Barre of the moſt awfull Court in the Kingdome, and with proſtrate humility to beſeech you, moſt Noble Lords, and you, moſt worthy Knights, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and Burgeſſes of the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (now aſſembled) to take into your prudent and pious conſideration the weighing of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent titles, and the poyſe of Religious reaſon, ſwaying the reſolution on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſide: and that, as you have occaſion to mention the day (by divine ordinance deſigned to the ſolemne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and the ſalvation of man) in your Diſcuſſions or Decrees, you will bee pleaſed to give it that authentick and edifying appellation, which beſt ſerveth to uphold the ſureſt tenure by which it holdeth, and moſt mindeth us of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſervation to which, by many and weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we are obliged; whereby, as it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h been moſt highly honoured from heaven (by Gods owne
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65743:122"/>hand writing in the fourth Commandement) ſo it may bee ratified by the higheſt authority on earth (the higheſt to us, <hi>viz.</hi> an Act of Parliament) to ſecure it from contempt, and to reſtore it to the right, whereof many, either in ſimple ignorance, or inconſiderate raſhneſſe, or audacious profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or partiall prejudice, or in politicke impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (for all theſe are Antiſabbatary ſymptomes in ſome or other) have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it.</p>
                  <p>You have already (to the great joy of the godly throughout the Land, raiſed your devout in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt the indignity done to Religion, by the moſt irreligious Pamphlet of Doctor <hi>Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> (though compoſed and publiſhed under the ſacred title of a Sermon;) and if now, as by an act of your Juſtice, <hi>SUNDAY NO SAB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BATH muſt burn;</hi> ſo, by ſome act of your Grace, <hi>SUNDAY A SABBATH may ſhine,</hi> (and the ſame holy zeale will diſpoſe you to this double devotion) you will further advance his honour, (who hath promiſed to returne you like for like in that kinde, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.) and hee will doe it not onely in kinde, but in degree, and give us of the Clergie the better meanes to perſwade the people with better mindes, to compoſe themſelves to all due obedience for what your Honours ſhall decree concerning their dutie both to God and man.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And ſo I conclude the titles of our weekly Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65743:122"/>which will both conduce to the contracting of our taske, and to the clearing of the truth to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, when wee come to deliver more materiall obſervations: which from henceforward are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and which we ſhall begin in another Booke, and goe on withall, as God giveth ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and opportunity to publiſh, what this great and weighty cauſe of his and his Church requireth at our hands.</p>
